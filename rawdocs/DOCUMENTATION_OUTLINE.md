## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Immediate)
1. Getting Started - Essential for adoption
2. Core Concepts - Foundation understanding
3. API Reference - Daily usage reference

### Phase 2 (Near-term)
4. Data Structures - Advanced usage
5. Provider System - Extension needs
6. Capability Testing - Quality assurance

### Phase 3 (Future)
7. Advanced Usage - Power user features
8. Migration & Integration - Ecosystem adoption

## Cross-References and Linking Strategy

### Module Documentation Integration
- Link directly to source files using `file://` URLs
- Reference specific line ranges for implementation details
- Maintain bidirectional links between guides and module docs

### Example Code Strategy  
- Extract examples from actual test files when possible
- Maintain examples as separate files that can be tested
- Use doctest where appropriate in module documentation

### Search and Navigation
- Consistent cross-referencing between guides
- Tag-based organization for finding related topics
- Progressive disclosure from basic to advanced concepts

## Special Sections

### Testing Documentation
Each guide should include relevant testing approaches:
- Unit testing patterns
- Integration testing with fixtures
- Live capability verification
- Property-based testing where applicable

### Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions integrated into relevant guides:
- Provider authentication errors
- Rate limiting and retry patterns  
- Streaming connection issues
- Model capability mismatches

### Performance Considerations
Practical guidance for production usage:
- Connection pooling with Req
- Streaming optimization
- Cost monitoring strategies
- Caching patterns for embeddings

## Documentation Quality Standards

### Code Examples
- All examples must be runnable
- Show both simple and complex usage patterns
- Include error handling examples
- Demonstrate configuration options

### Writing Style
- Terse, direct language for technical audience
- No emojis or unnecessary verbosity
- Focus on practical implementation
- Include performance implications

### Maintenance
- Documentation should be testable where possible
- Examples should be extracted from working code
- Regular verification against live APIs
- Version-specific guidance where needed
