          "text": "# The Dragon Singers of Valemoor\n\n## Part I: The Last of the Scaled Ones\n\nThe day the last great dragon of the Mistpeak Mountains fell was remembered across the five kingdoms as the Day of Ash. For three days and nights, black snow drifted from the sky, coating the villages and farmlands of Valemoor in a fine, sooty powder. Children were forbidden from playing outdoors. Livestock refused to graze. And in the taverns and great halls, people whispered that the age of dragons had finally come to an end.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nKira Nightwind was twelve years old when the ash fell. She watched it from the small window of her family's cottage on the outskirts of Willowbrook, a tiny hamlet nestled in the shadow of the Mistpeaks. Unlike the others, who covered their faces and hurried about their business, Kira stood in the doorway, palm outstretched, catching the black flakes as they drifted down.\n\n\"It's warm,\" she said, turning to her grandfather, who sat by the hearth, his weathered face illuminated by the flickering flames.\n\nAlaric Nightwind had once been the greatest dragon singer in Valemoor, back when such a profession still existed. Now he was merely an old man with stories no one believed.\n\n\"Of course it's warm,\" he said, his voice a low rumble like distant thunder. \"It's dragon ash. The heat of their magic lingers long after death.\"\n\nKira closed her hand around the ash, feeling it dissolve against her skin. \"How did it die, Grandfather? Was it hunters?\"\n\nAlaric's eyes, still sharp despite his advanced years, fixed on her. \"No hunter has managed to kill a great dragon in five hundred years, child. They're too clever, too powerful. This one died of age, or perhaps grief. They say it was the last, but...\" He trailed off, staring into the fire.\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"The dragons are never truly gone, Kira. They merely wait.\"\n\nFive years later, Kira would remember those words as she stood at her grandfather's grave, the last of her family, with nothing but his dragon singer's flute – a long, slender instrument carved from bone – and a book of lore so ancient its pages crumbled at the edges. The village elders had given her until the next full moon to vacate the cottage; no one wanted to live near the home of a dragon singer, not even one long retired.\n\nThe dragon singers had once been revered throughout Valemoor, their magic a bridge between humankind and dragonkind. They alone could speak the ancient language, could soothe the great beasts in times of fury, could negotiate the delicate peace that had lasted for a thousand years. But as dragons became scarcer, as the kingdom expanded and forests fell to make way for farmland and cities, the singers became obsolete. Then feared. Then hated.\n\nThe last purge had happened fifty years before Kira's birth, when King Aldric the Resolute ordered all known dragon singers executed. Alaric had survived only by renouncing his title and retreating to Willowbrook, where he took up the trade of a simple woodcarver. But he had never stopped being what he was, and in secret, he had passed his knowledge to his granddaughter.\n\nNow, with nothing left to lose, Kira decided it was time to discover if the dragons were truly gone – or if, as her grandfather had believed, they were merely waiting.\n\nShe packed lightly: the bone flute, the book of lore, a change of clothes, a hunting knife, and provisions enough for a week's journey. The villagers watched her go with a mixture of pity and relief, certain she was destined for a pauper's life in one of the coastal cities. None suspected her true destination: the highest peaks of the Mistpeak Mountains, where legend said the last dragons had made their sanctuary.\n\nThe journey would take her through the haunted forests of Grimwood, across the Silvertide River, and up treacherous paths no human had tread in generations. It would test not only her physical endurance but her courage and conviction.\n\nBut Kira Nightwind was no ordinary seventeen-year-old. In her veins ran the blood of thirteen generations of dragon singers, and in her mind echoed the ancient songs her grandfather had taught her – songs of calling, songs of binding, songs of flight and flame and freedom.\n\nAs she set out on the old forest road, the morning sun at her back, she began to hum one of these songs – a simple melody that made the air around her shimmer slightly, as if heated. Birds fell silent as she passed. Small animals froze in their tracks. And deep in the highest cave of the tallest peak, something that had been sleeping for a very long time opened one golden eye.\n\nThe Last Dragon was awakening.\n\n## Part II: The Grimwood\n\nThe Grimwood earned its name honestly. Whereas the forests near Willowbrook were friendly places of dappled sunlight and chattering wildlife, the Grimwood existed in perpetual twilight. Massive ancient trees with trunks wider than village cottages reached hundreds of feet into the air, their dense canopies blocking out all but the most determined rays of sun. The forest floor was a tangled mess of roots, fungi, and plants that seemed to shift and move when viewed from the corner of one's eye.\n\nKira had been traveling for three days when she first realized she was being followed.\n\nIt was nothing obvious – a twig snapping when the wind was still, the sensation of eyes watching from the shadows, footprints that appeared in the soft earth of the path behind her when she was certain no one had passed. At first, she dismissed it as forest creatures, curious about this human intruder. But by the third night, as she made camp in a small clearing, she knew better.\n\n\"You might as well show yourself,\" she said to the darkness beyond her small fire. \"I've known you've been there since yesterday.\"\n\nSilence answered her. Then a low, raspy chuckle.\n\n\"Clever girl,\" said a voice from the shadows. \"Most don't notice me until it's far too late.\"\n\nThe figure that stepped into the firelight was tall and lean, draped in a patchwork cloak of green and brown that seemed to capture and reflect the forest's patterns. The hood was pulled low, but Kira could make out a sharp-featured face with skin the color of aged parchment and eyes that glinted like polished amber.\n\n\"I am Thorne,\" the stranger said, offering a slight bow. \"Warden of the Grimwood, protector of its secrets, and—\" here he paused, studying her with those unnerving eyes, \"—collector of interesting travelers.\"\n\nKira's hand drifted to the hunting knife at her belt. \"I mean no harm to your forest, Warden. I'm just passing through.\"\n\nThorne circled the fire, moving with an odd, fluid grace that reminded Kira of a predator stalking prey. \"No one 'just passes through' the Grimwood, child. This forest has been avoided by sensible folk for three generations. Which makes me wonder – what brings a young girl with a dragon singer's flute so deep into my domain?\"\n\nKira stiffened. \"How do you know what this is?\" she asked, her hand now protectively covering the bone flute that hung from a cord around her neck.\n\nThorne's thin lips curled into a smile that didn't reach his eyes. \"I am very old, little singer. I remember when your kind walked proudly among the kingdoms, before fear turned the hearts of men against you. I remember the last dragon singer who passed this way – a tall man with silver in his beard and fire in his eyes. Your grandfather, perhaps?\"\n\n\"You knew Alaric?\"\n\n\"Knew him? I guided him, just as I guided his father before him, and his grandmother before that. The Nightwind family has a long history of seeking dragons in these mountains.\" Thorne's expression softened slightly. \"He succeeded, you know. Found what he was looking for. But he chose to return to the world of men. A choice I never understood.\"\n\nHope flared in Kira's chest. \"Then there are dragons still? They're not all gone?\"\n\nThorne's amber eyes reflected the firelight, making them seem to glow from within. \"That depends, Kira Nightwind, on what you intend to do if you find one.\"\n\nThe fact that he knew her name without being told should have frightened her, but somehow it didn't. There was something ancient about Thorne, something that went beyond human concerns of age and time.\n\n\"I intend to learn,\" she said firmly. \"My grandfather taught me the songs, the history, the old ways of communion between dragon and singer. But he never showed me a living dragon. If they still exist, I want to see them. To understand them. To ensure they're not forgotten.\"\n\nThorne studied her for a long moment, his head tilted like a curious bird. Then he nodded, seemingly satisfied.\n\n\"A worthy goal, though not without peril. The path you seek is dangerous, young singer. The mountains are treacherous even in summer, and winter comes early to the high peaks. And there are... other dangers.\"\n\n\"What other dangers?\"\n\nThorne's expression darkened. \"The dragons are not the only ancient beings to retreat from the world of men. And not all who dwell in these wild places are as... amenable to human visitors as I am.\"\n\nHe seated himself across the fire from her, his movements still unnervingly graceful. \"Rest tonight. In the morning, I will show you a path through the Grimwood that will save you days of wandering. But beyond the forest, you must find your own way.\"\n\nKira nodded, relief mingling with a renewed sense of purpose. \"Thank you, Warden.\"\n\nThorne's smile was enigmatic. \"Don't thank me yet, little singer. The road ahead may lead you to wonders beyond imagining – or to your doom. The dragons remember the betrayals of mankind. If any still live in these mountains, they will not welcome you with open arms.\"\n\n\"My grandfather always said that dragons respect courage and truth above all else,\" Kira replied. \"I have nothing to offer them but those things.\"\n\n\"Then you are better prepared than most,\" Thorne said softly. \"Now sleep. The Grimwood holds many secrets, but for tonight, at least, you are under my protection.\"\n\nAs Kira settled into her bedroll, watching the strange forest warden through the flames, she couldn't help but wonder what other secrets this journey would reveal – and whether she was truly prepared to face them.\n\n## Part III: The Silvertide Crossing\n\nThe path Thorne showed her the next morning could hardly be called a path at all. It was more a suggestion, a slight depression in the forest floor, occasionally marked by stones carved with symbols Kira didn't recognize. But it led true, and by midday, the perpetual twilight of the Grimwood began to brighten. By late afternoon, she emerged from the tree line to find herself facing the greatest challenge of her journey thus far: the Silvertide River.\n\nIn summer, the Silvertide was said to be a gentle, meandering waterway, easily crossed at numerous fords. But autumn had brought heavy rains to the mountains, and what lay before Kira now was a churning, foaming mass of water nearly fifty yards across, swollen with runoff from the peaks above.\n\nShe stood at the river's edge, watching the powerful current sweep branches and debris downstream, and felt her heart sink. There was no bridge in sight, no obvious crossing point. Swimming would be suicide.\n\n\"Well,\" she muttered to herself, \"this is an unexpected complication.\"\n\nAs if in response, a deep, booming voice called out: \"Ho there! You looking to cross?\"\n\nStartled, Kira turned to see a massive figure emerging from a crude shelter half-hidden among the rocks near the riverbank. The man who approached was enormous – nearly seven feet tall and broad as a bear, with a wild mane of red hair and a beard that reached almost to his belt. He was dressed in mismatched leather and fur, and he carried what appeared to be a homemade oar taller than Kira herself.\n\n\"The name's Bram,\" he announced, coming to a stop a few paces from her. \"Bram Riverson.",
