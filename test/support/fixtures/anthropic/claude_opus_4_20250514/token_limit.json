          "text": "# The Last Dragon Keeper\n\n## Chapter 1: The Prophecy Unfolds\n\nThe morning mist clung to the mountainside like a shroud as Lyra made her way up the ancient stone steps. Each footfall echoed in the silence, a rhythmic counterpoint to her racing heart. Today was her sixteenth birthday, and according to tradition, she would finally learn the truth about her family's legacy.\n\nThe Temple of Scales stood at the peak of Mount Aethermoor, its obsidian spires reaching toward the clouds like grasping fingers. For generations, the Thornwood family had served as its guardians, though what exactly they guarded remained a mystery to those who had not yet come of age.\n\n\"Lyra Thornwood,\" a voice called from within the temple as she approached the massive iron doors. They swung open without anyone touching them, revealing her grandmother, Sage Elara, dressed in ceremonial robes of deep purple embroidered with silver thread that seemed to move like living smoke.\n\n\"Grandmother,\" Lyra bowed respectfully, trying to calm her nerves.\n\n\"Come, child. It is time.\"\n\nThe interior of the temple was vast, its vaulted ceiling disappearing into darkness. Crystalline formations along the walls cast an ethereal blue light, illuminating ancient murals that depicted great winged beasts in flight. Dragons. Lyra's breath caught as she recognized the creatures from old stories—stories everyone claimed were just myths.\n\nSage Elara led her to the temple's heart, where a circular chamber opened before them. In its center stood a pedestal holding what appeared to be a large egg made of black stone, its surface covered in intricate golden runes that pulsed with a faint inner light.\n\n\"The last dragon egg,\" her grandmother announced solemnly. \"For three hundred years, our family has protected it, waiting for the one prophesied to awaken it.\"\n\nLyra stared at the egg in disbelief. \"Dragons are real?\"\n\n\"Were real,\" Elara corrected. \"The great war between dragons and the Shadow King Malachar destroyed them all—save for this one egg. The prophecy speaks of a Thornwood who will restore the dragons to our world when darkness threatens to consume it once more.\"\n\nAs if responding to her words, the egg's golden runes flared brighter. A warm sensation spread through Lyra's chest, and she found herself stepping forward, drawn by an irresistible force.\n\n\"Grandmother, I—\" She reached out her hand.\n\nThe moment her fingers touched the smooth surface, the world exploded into light and sound. Visions flooded her mind: great dragons soaring through crystal-clear skies, their scales shimmering in every color imaginable; terrible battles where fire met shadow; and through it all, a voice—ancient, powerful, and somehow familiar—calling her name.\n\nThe egg cracked.\n\n## Chapter 2: The Awakening\n\n\"Get back!\" Sage Elara shouted, but Lyra couldn't move. Energy coursed through her body, holding her in place as fractures spread across the egg's surface like a spider's web. Heat radiated from within, growing more intense with each passing second.\n\nWith a sound like thunder, the egg split apart. Lyra was thrown backward, landing hard on the stone floor as chunks of black shell scattered across the chamber. Where the egg had been, a small form now lay curled on the pedestal—a dragon hatchling no bigger than a house cat.\n\nIts scales were the deepest black Lyra had ever seen, seeming to absorb light rather than reflect it. But when the creature opened its eyes, they blazed with golden fire. It stretched, unfurling wings that seemed too large for its body, and let out a sound somewhere between a chirp and a roar.\n\n\"Impossible,\" Elara breathed. \"The egg was petrified. It should have taken powerful magic and months of rituals to—\"\n\nThe dragon's head snapped toward Lyra, and their eyes met. In that instant, she felt something click into place within her mind—a connection, a bond that ran deeper than thought or emotion. She could feel the dragon's curiosity, its hunger, its... amusement?\n\n*Finally,* a voice echoed in her head, young but unmistakably draconic. *I was beginning to think I'd be stuck in that shell forever.*\n\nLyra gasped. \"Did you just—\"\n\n*Speak to you? Of course. We're bonded now.* The dragon hopped down from the pedestal and padded toward her on legs that seemed slightly too long for its body. *I'm Shadowmere. And you're my rider.*\n\n\"Rider?\" Lyra looked to her grandmother for explanation, but Elara's face had gone pale.\n\n\"The prophecy,\" the old woman whispered. \"It's beginning. Lyra, you must listen carefully. The awakening of the last dragon can mean only one thing—\"\n\nA tremendous crash shook the temple. Dust rained from the ceiling as something massive struck the building from outside. Through the walls, they could hear screaming.\n\n\"What's happening?\" Lyra scrambled to her feet, Shadowmere pressing close to her legs.\n\nSage Elara's expression hardened. \"They've found us. Malachar's servants—the Void Cult. They must have sensed the egg's awakening.\" She rushed to a wall and pressed her hand against a hidden panel. A section of stone slid away, revealing a cache of weapons and armor. \"You must flee. Take Shadowmere and get to the Northern Sanctuary. Find Master Chen—he'll know what to do.\"\n\n\"I'm not leaving you!\"\n\nAnother impact rocked the temple. This time, cracks appeared in the walls. Through them seeped an unnatural darkness that seemed to move with malevolent purpose.\n\n\"You must!\" Elara pressed a leather satchel into Lyra's hands. \"Everything you need is in here—maps, supplies, and your parents' journal. They died protecting the secret of the egg's location. Don't let their sacrifice be in vain.\"\n\n*She's right,* Shadowmere's mental voice was urgent. *I can feel them—creatures of shadow and hate. We're not strong enough to fight them. Not yet.*\n\nLyra wanted to argue, but the wall behind her grandmother suddenly exploded inward. Through the breach poured creatures of nightmare—humanoid in shape but composed entirely of writhing shadows, their eyes burning with purple fire.\n\nSage Elara raised her staff, and silver light erupted from its tip. \"Go! Now!\"\n\nGrabbing Shadowmere and clutching him to her chest, Lyra ran. Behind her, she could hear her grandmother chanting in the old tongue, the clash of magic against magic. Tears streamed down her face as she burst through a side door and into the morning light.\n\nThe village below Mount Aethermoor was in chaos. Shadow creatures swarmed through the streets while villagers fled in panic. Buildings burned with unnatural black flames that gave off no heat but seemed to devour the very light around them.\n\n*This way!* Shadowmere squirmed in her arms, indicating a narrow path leading into the forest.\n\nLyra didn't hesitate. She plunged into the tree line, branches catching at her clothes and hair. Behind them, an inhuman howl rose from the temple—a sound of triumph that made her blood run cold. She forced herself not to look back.\n\nThey ran until Lyra's lungs burned and her legs trembled with exhaustion. Finally, when she could go no further, she collapsed beside a stream, gasping for breath. Shadowmere curled up beside her, his small body radiating warmth.\n\n*I'm sorry about your grandmother,* he said quietly.\n\nLyra couldn't speak past the lump in her throat. Instead, she opened the satchel Elara had given her. Inside, she found dried food, a water flask, a belt knife, a pouch of coins, and a leather-bound journal. The cover bore her family's seal—a dragon coiled around a flowering tree.\n\nWith trembling hands, she opened it to the first page and recognized her mother's handwriting:\n\n*\"My dearest Lyra, if you are reading this, then the time has come. The world needs the dragons once more, and you, my brave daughter, are the key to their return...\"*\n\n## Chapter 3: The Northern Road\n\nThree days had passed since the attack on Mount Aethermoor. Lyra and Shadowmere had traveled mostly at night, hiding during the day in whatever shelter they could find—abandoned barns, dense thickets, once in a cave that Shadowmere assured her didn't smell *too* much like bear.\n\nThe dragon had grown rapidly, now the size of a large dog. His appetite had grown proportionally, and Lyra had quickly learned that a hungry dragon was a grumpy dragon.\n\n*I'm a growing drake,* Shadowmere complained as they made their way along a merchant road in the pre-dawn darkness. *I need protein. That rabbit you caught yesterday was barely a snack.*\n\n\"Well, unless you want to risk hunting in the villages, you'll have to make do,\" Lyra replied. She'd grown more comfortable with their mental communication, though it still felt strange to have another consciousness brushing against her thoughts.\n\nShe'd spent her resting hours reading her parents' journal, learning about the true history of dragons and their riders. The bond between them was sacred—a melding of souls that allowed them to share strength, knowledge, and power. But it came with a price: if one died, the other would likely follow, consumed by the grief of a severed bond.\n\nThe journal also spoke of the Shadow King Malachar, who had once been a dragon rider himself. His dragon, Nethysara, had been corrupted by dark magic, and together they had waged war against the other riders. The conflict had ended with Malachar's apparent defeat, but at a terrible cost—every dragon save the egg that would become Shadowmere had perished.\n\n*Someone's coming,* Shadowmere warned, interrupting her thoughts.\n\nLyra quickly guided him off the road and into the bushes. A moment later, a wagon appeared around the bend, pulled by two draft horses and driven by a young man who couldn't have been much older than Lyra herself. He was whistling a cheerful tune, seemingly without a care in the world.\n\nAs the wagon drew closer, one of its wheels hit a deep rut. The vehicle lurched violently, and several crates tumbled from the back. The driver cursed colorfully and pulled the horses to a stop.\n\n\"Perfect. Just perfect,\" he muttered, climbing down to inspect the damage. \"Father said, 'Take the short cut, Marcus. Save a day's travel.' Well, look where that got me.\"\n\nLyra watched from her hiding spot as Marcus struggled to lift one of the heavy crates. He was clearly a merchant's son, with fine clothes now dusty from travel and hands that showed little sign of hard labor. \n\n*We should help him,* Shadowmere suggested.\n\n*Are you crazy? We're supposed to be hiding.*\n\n*He's alone and harmless. Besides, that wagon would get us to the Northern Sanctuary much faster than walking.*\n\nLyra hesitated. The dragon had a point. Her feet were blistered, and they still had leagues to go. Before she could talk herself out of it, she stood and stepped onto the road.\n\n\"Need some help?\"\n\nMarcus jumped, nearly dropping the crate on his foot. \"Gods above! Where did you come from?\" He squinted at her in the dim light. \"Are you alone out here?\"\n\n\"I... got separated from my family,\" Lyra said, which wasn't entirely a lie. \"I've been walking all night.\"\n\nMarcus's expression softened. \"That's rough. Look, help me get these crates back on the wagon, and I'll give you a ride to the next town. Deal?\"\n\n\"Deal.\" Lyra moved to help him, carefully keeping Shadowmere hidden in the underbrush. Through their bond, she could feel his amusement at her deception.\n\nTogether, they managed to reload the wagon. Marcus was surprisingly easy to talk to, chattering about his father's trading business and his dreams of seeing the great cities of the south. Lyra found herself relaxing slightly—it was nice to have normal human conversation after days of fear and flight.\n\n\"So where are you headed?\" Marcus asked as he helped her onto the wagon's bench.\n\n\"North,\" Lyra said vaguely. \"I have family in the mountain settlements.\"\n\n\"Lucky timing then. I'm going as far as Thornhaven—that's about two days north of here.\" He clicked his tongue, and the horses started forward. \"Though I've got to warn you, there've been strange stories coming from the north. Dark creatures, people",
