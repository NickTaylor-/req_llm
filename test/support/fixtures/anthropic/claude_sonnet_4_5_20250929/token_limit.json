          "text": "# The Chronicles of the Shattered Sky\n\n## Part I: The Awakening\n\nThe morning Kieran discovered he could speak to dragons was the same morning his village burned to the ground.\n\nHe had been gathering firewood in the foothills of the Cloudspire Mountains, his breath forming small clouds in the crisp autumn air, when he heard it—not with his ears, but somehow deeper, resonating in his chest like the lowest note of a great bell. It was a voice, ancient and vast, speaking words he had never learned but somehow understood perfectly.\n\n*\"Child of ash and ember, the time of choosing comes.\"*\n\nKieran dropped his bundle of sticks, spinning around to find the source of the voice. There, perched on an outcropping of stone thirty feet above him, sat a dragon.\n\nNot one of the great wyrms from the stories his grandmother told, not one of the massive beasts that had supposedly ruled the skies in the age before the Sundering. This dragon was smaller—perhaps the size of a large horse—with scales that shimmered between copper and gold in the early light. Its eyes were the color of molten amber, and they fixed on him with an intelligence that made his knees weak.\n\n\"I... I can hear you,\" Kieran whispered, his voice cracking. He was only sixteen, gangly and awkward, the son of a blacksmith in a village so small it didn't even have a proper name. They just called it Millbrook, after the stream that powered the grain mill.\n\n*\"Yes,\"* the dragon responded, and Kieran realized its mouth hadn't moved. The voice was in his mind, warm and resonant. *\"You are one of the Listeners. We thought your kind had died out.\"*\n\n\"Listeners? I don't understand. Dragons haven't been seen in the valleys for two hundred years. My gran said you all flew east after the Sundering, beyond the Waste—\"\n\nThe dragon's head snapped up suddenly, looking past Kieran toward the valley below. Its entire body tensed, wings flaring slightly.\n\n*\"Run, young Listener. Run now. They come.\"*\n\n\"Who comes? What—\"\n\nAnd then Kieran smelled it. Smoke. Not the clean smoke of cooking fires or forge bellows, but the acrid, terrifying smell of burning thatch and timber. He turned and ran, scrambling down the hillside, rocks sliding under his boots, branches tearing at his clothes and face. Behind him, he heard the snap of great wings as the dragon took flight.\n\nBy the time he reached the valley floor, the eastern sky had turned black with smoke. Millbrook was burning. And circling above it like vultures were shapes that made his heart seize—dragons, yes, but wrong somehow. Their scales were the color of old iron, their eyes like red coals, and they moved with a jerking, unnatural motion as they dove and breathed gouts of flame onto the buildings below.\n\nKieran ran faster than he'd ever run in his life, his lungs burning, his vision narrowing to a tunnel focused on his home. He could see people fleeing—tiny figures running like ants from a kicked hill. He could hear screaming.\n\n*\"Stop!\"* The voice crashed through his mind like thunder, and Kieran stumbled, falling to his knees in the meadow grass. The copper-gold dragon landed in front of him, blocking his path. *\"You cannot help them. Those are not true dragons—they are the Blighted, servants of the Shadow King. They were sent to find you.\"*\n\n\"Me? Why me? I'm nobody! My family—my father, my mother, my sister—\"\n\n*\"If you go now, you will die, and your death will make their sacrifice meaningless.\"* The dragon's voice was gentler now, but no less firm. *\"The Blighted can sense those with dragon-speech. That is why they came. If you value your family's lives, you will live to fight the one who sent these abominations.\"*\n\nTears streamed down Kieran's face as he watched his world burn. He could see the mill collapsing, could see the great sheets of flame consuming the thatcher's house where his friend Tomas lived. The smoke rose in a pillar that seemed to prop up the sky.\n\n\"I don't know how to fight,\" he said, his voice breaking. \"I'm just a blacksmith's son.\"\n\n*\"Then you will learn,\"* the dragon said. *\"My name is Auryx, and I am the last of the Bronze Flight, sworn to protect the realm of men. I have searched for a Listener for twenty years. You are the first I have found. The Shadow King rises in the east, and his power grows with each passing day. He seeks to finish what was begun in the Sundering—to break the world and remake it in his image of darkness and servitude. Only a Rider can stop him.\"*\n\n\"A Rider?\"\n\n*\"One who speaks to dragons. One who can bond with dragonkind. One who can unite the scattered flights and forge them into a force strong enough to challenge the Shadow.\"* Auryx lowered her head, bringing her great amber eye level with Kieran's tear-stained face. *\"One like you. But only if you choose to accept this path.\"*\n\nKieran looked back at Millbrook one last time. The flames were beginning to die down, not because they were being quenched, but because there was nothing left to burn. His home was gone. His family was likely dead. Everything he had known had been destroyed in less than an hour.\n\nHe could lie down in this meadow and weep. He could wait for the Blighted dragons to find him and end his grief with fire.\n\nOr he could stand up.\n\n\"What do I need to do?\" Kieran asked, wiping his face with the back of his hand.\n\nAuryx's voice carried something that might have been approval. *\"First, you need to survive. Climb onto my back. I will take you somewhere safe, where you can begin your training. The Shadow King has made his move. Now we must make ours.\"*\n\nWith trembling hands, Kieran grasped the ridges along Auryx's neck and pulled himself up onto her back. Her scales were warm beneath him, and when she launched herself into the sky with two powerful beats of her wings, he felt his stomach drop away.\n\nBelow, Millbrook continued to burn. Above, the sky stretched endless and blue. And ahead, somewhere beyond the horizon, an enemy waited.\n\nKieran didn't know it then, but this was the moment everything changed. This was the moment the last Rider came into his power, and the moment the world began its slow, painful turn back toward the light.\n\nThis was the beginning.\n\n## Part II: The Dragon Keep\n\nThey flew for three days, stopping only when darkness made flight dangerous or when Auryx needed to hunt. Kieran learned quickly that dragons were carnivores with prodigious appetites—he watched in fascination and slight horror as Auryx brought down a mountain goat on the second day, consuming it bones and all.\n\n*\"We need the calcium,\"* she explained, sounding almost amused at his expression. *\"Dragon bones are not like human bones. They are hollow, like a bird's, but reinforced with a crystalline matrix that gives them strength. Without proper nutrition, we cannot maintain them.\"*\n\n\"Is that why you eat so much?\" Kieran asked. They were perched on a ledge high in the mountains, so high that the air was thin and cold, and Kieran had to wrap himself in the spare cloak Auryx had been carrying in a saddle bag he hadn't noticed before.\n\n*\"One reason. Flight requires tremendous energy. Even with the magical assistance inherent in our nature, we must consume vast quantities of food to sustain ourselves.\"*\n\n\"Magical assistance?\"\n\n*\"Dragons are creatures of magic as much as flesh. Our flight is only partially explained by our wings—there is a lifting force, a lightening of our being, that comes from the same source as our fire.\"* Auryx settled onto her haunches, wrapping her tail around herself like a cat. *\"Did they teach you nothing of dragons in your village?\"*\n\n\"Only stories,\" Kieran admitted. \"Gran said that before the Sundering, dragons and humans lived in harmony. She said there were Riders then, warriors who bonded with dragons and kept the peace across all the kingdoms. But then something happened—the Sundering—and the dragons left.\"\n\n*\"Your grandmother's stories have the shape of truth, though they lack the details.\"* Auryx gazed out across the endless expanse of mountains, her amber eyes distant. *\"There were indeed Riders, and they were glorious. The bond between dragon and human created something greater than either alone—a joining of human creativity and passion with draconic power and wisdom. Together, they could work miracles.\"*\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n*\"Treachery,\"* Auryx said, and her mental voice went cold. *\"One Rider, the greatest of them all, desired more power than the bond could give him. He began experimenting with dark magics, trying to force dragons to submit to his will rather than bonding with them as equals. He succeeded, after a fashion. He learned how to break a dragon's mind and make it his slave.\"*\n\nKieran felt sick. \"The Shadow King?\"\n\n*\"No. The Shadow King is the Shadow King's son, though he has long outlived a human's natural span through necromancy and worse.\"* Auryx's talons scraped against the stone. *\"The first Shadow King, Malachar the Betrayer, sparked the Sundering. When the other Riders learned what he was doing, they confronted him. The battle that followed shattered the kingdom of Ald Kethyr, turned a hundred miles of fertile land into the Blasted Waste, and killed nearly every Rider and dragon in the realm.\"*\n\n\"But you survived.\"\n\n*\"I was young then, barely out of the egg. My mother died in the Sundering, but she had hidden me well. I and a few others escaped. We flew east, as your grandmother said, and we scattered. We hoped that time would heal the wounds, that new Riders would emerge, that we might return one day.\"*\n\n\"Did they? Emerge, I mean?\"\n\n*\"No. The bloodline that carried the ability to speak with dragons was nearly wiped out in the Sundering. Those who survived scattered to remote villages, their gifts forgotten or suppressed. You are the first Listener I have found in twenty years of searching, Kieran. And you may be the last.\"*\n\nThe weight of that statement settled on Kieran's shoulders like a physical burden. \"Why now? Why did the Blighted attack my village now?\"\n\n*\"Because Malachar's son, who calls himself the Shadow King, has spent two centuries gathering power. He has learned his father's dark arts and surpassed them. He creates the Blighted—dragons whose minds and souls have been ripped away, leaving only obedient shells. He raises armies of undead. He bends kingdoms to his will through fear and corruption. And now, he seeks to finish his father's work.\"*\n\n\"By killing anyone who might become a Rider.\"\n\n*\"Yes. His servants scour the lands, hunting for anyone with even a trace of the gift. Your village was destroyed because he sensed you awakening to your power.\"*\n\nKieran was quiet for a long moment. \"How many did he kill to get to me?\"\n\n*\"That is not a helpful question.\"*\n\n\"How many, Auryx?\"\n\nThe dragon sighed, a sound like wind through a canyon. *\"Perhaps two hundred souls.\"*\n\nTwo hundred people. Everyone Kieran had ever known. His mother, who made the best berry pies in the valley. His father, who had been teaching him the secrets of the forge, how to judge steel by its color and ring. His little sister Maya, who was only eight and loved to collect river stones and make up elaborate stories about where they'd come from.\n\nAll dead. Because of him.\n\n\"I should have died with them,\" Kieran whispered.\n\n*\"No.\"* Auryx's voice was sharp, cutting through his despair. *\"That is the Shadow King's victory—making you believe that you are responsible for his evil. He killed them, not you. He sent the Blighted. He gave the order. Your only crime was being born with a gift.\"*\n\n\"Some gift.\"\n\n*\"Yes,\"* Auryx agreed. *\"Some gift. The gift that might save the world, if you are brave enough to accept it.\"*\n\nThey flew on as the sun set, painting the mountains in shades of orange and purple. Kieran didn't speak, lost in his grief and the terrible weight of expectation. He was nobody. He couldn't save the world. He couldn't even save his own family.\n\nBut as darkness fell and the stars emerged, brilliant and cold, he made",
