          "text": "# The Last Scale of Azurath\n\n## Part One: The Awakening\n\nThe village of Millbrook had stood in the shadow of the Serpent's Spine Mountains for three hundred years without incident. Its people tended their sheep, harvested their barley, and told old stories around winter fires—stories of dragons that their great-grandparents swore were true, though no one living had ever seen such a creature. Dragons, the villagers had come to believe, were nothing more than legends, cautionary tales to frighten children into obedience.\n\nKira Stormwind had never believed in dragons either, despite her family name. At seventeen, she was more concerned with mastering her apprenticeship at the village forge than with ancient myths. Her hands bore the calluses of her trade, and her dark hair was perpetually singed at the ends from standing too close to the flames. Her master, old Gareth Ironhand, often said she had a gift for metalwork that came once in a generation—an almost magical ability to sense what the metal wanted to become.\n\nIt was on the first day of autumn, when the leaves had just begun to turn gold and crimson, that everything changed.\n\nKira was working late in the forge, hammer ringing against an ornate gate commission for the mayor's house, when the first tremor struck. The tools hanging on the walls rattled, and the water in the cooling barrel rippled in concentric circles. She paused, hammer raised, listening. The mountains had always been stable; earthquakes were unheard of in this region.\n\nThe second tremor was stronger. A great rumbling filled the air, not from beneath but from above, as though the sky itself was groaning under some immense weight. Kira dropped her hammer and ran outside, joining the other villagers who had emerged from their homes to stare upward in confusion and growing fear.\n\nThe sun was setting, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple, but there was something else up there—a shape, vast and dark, moving against the clouds. At first, Kira thought it might be a storm front moving in, but storms didn't have wings. Storms didn't have eyes that glowed like molten gold.\n\n\"Dragon!\" someone screamed, and panic erupted in the streets.\n\nThe creature descended with terrible grace, each beat of its massive wings creating gusts that tore thatched roofs from houses and sent market stalls tumbling through the square. It was enormous—larger than the village meeting hall—with scales that shimmered deep blue and purple in the fading light, like a night sky made solid. Its tail, long and serpentine, carved through the air behind it, and from its mouth came wisps of blue-white smoke.\n\nThe dragon landed in the village square with an impact that cracked the cobblestones. Villagers fled in all directions, but Kira found herself frozen, unable to look away from the magnificent, terrifying creature. Up close, she could see that its scales were scratched and scarred, some hanging loose. One of its great horns was broken halfway down, and there was a deep wound along its shoulder that leaked a luminous silver fluid.\n\nThis dragon was hurt.\n\nThe creature's golden eyes swept across the panicking villagers and then locked onto Kira. She felt the weight of that gaze like a physical thing, pressing against her chest, making it hard to breathe. Then, impossibly, a voice resonated in her mind—ancient, deep, and unutterably weary.\n\n\"Metalshaper,\" the voice said. \"I have searched long for one such as you. I am dying, and with me dies knowledge that must not be lost.\"\n\nKira found her voice, though it came out as barely a whisper. \"What... what do you want from me?\"\n\nThe dragon lowered its great head, bringing one eye level with Kira. This close, she could see her reflection in that golden orb, could feel the heat radiating from the creature's body. \"I am Azurath, last of the Sky Dragons, keeper of the ancient covenant. I bear a burden that I can carry no longer. Will you hear my tale, young metalshaper? Will you accept what I must give?\"\n\nBehind her, Kira could hear Master Gareth calling her name, begging her to run, but she couldn't move. Some instinct deeper than fear held her in place. This was a moment that would define the rest of her life—she knew it with bone-deep certainty.\n\n\"I'll listen,\" she said.\n\nThe dragon's eye seemed to brighten, and if such a creature could look relieved, it did. \"Then come closer, child. Place your hand upon my scales. What I must tell you is not for all ears, and time grows short.\"\n\nWith trembling legs, Kira stepped forward. She reached out and placed her palm against the dragon's scales. They were warm and surprisingly smooth, thrumming with an inner energy that made her metalworking tools feel crude and dead by comparison. The moment her skin made contact, the world around her vanished.\n\n## Part Two: The Memory of Dragons\n\nKira found herself standing in a different world—or perhaps the same world, but in a different time. The Serpent's Spine Mountains were there, but younger, more jagged, with peaks that scratched the belly of the sky. And the sky itself was full of dragons.\n\nThey soared in dozens, hundreds perhaps, each one unique in color and form. Some were massive, dwarfing even Azurath, their wingspans wide enough to cast entire valleys into shadow. Others were smaller, swift and agile, darting between their larger kin like schools of fish. They came in every color imaginable—crimson red and forest green, pure white and deepest black, some shimmering with scales that seemed to shift through multiple hues, others adorned with spines and horns in fantastic arrangements.\n\n\"This was the Age of Wings,\" Azurath's voice echoed through the vision, \"when my kind ruled the skies and the world was young. We were not mindless beasts, as the stories say, but a civilization as old and complex as any that has risen since. We built no cities of stone, for the sky was our dwelling. We forged no tools, for our claws and teeth and fire were sufficient. But we were wise, young one. We understood secrets of the world that your kind has forgotten.\"\n\nThe scene shifted. Now Kira saw humans, but they looked different from any people she knew—taller, with strange symbols glowing faintly on their skin, their eyes bright with power. They stood in council with dragons, the two species gathered around a massive circular stone covered in glowing runes.\n\n\"In the beginning, we shared the world with your ancestors—the Old Ones, they were called. Together we forged the Covenant of Balance. Your kind would tend the earth and all things that grew there. My kind would guard the sky and all things that flew beneath it. Neither would seek dominance over the other. This stone you see was the seal of that covenant, carved with binding magic from both our peoples.\"\n\nKira watched as the scene shifted again, moving faster now through centuries. She saw dragons and humans working together, saw great wonders created—floating cities, storms tamed, mountains moved. But then something changed. The glowing symbols on human skin began to fade. The Old Ones were disappearing, being replaced by ordinary humans like Kira herself. And as humanity changed, fear crept in.\n\n\"Your kind forgot,\" Azurath said sadly. \"The Old Ones passed, and their descendants did not remember the Covenant. They saw dragons and felt only terror. They saw our fire and thought only of destruction. And there were some among my kind—young, angry, foolish—who responded to fear with violence. The balance broke.\"\n\nNow Kira witnessed horrors: dragons burning villages, humans wielding strange weapons that brought down even the mightiest dragons from the sky, neither side understanding why the other had turned hostile. The war raged for generations, and with each passing year, there were fewer dragons in the sky.\n\n\"We were dying,\" Azurath continued. \"Not just from your weapons, but from something deeper. The breaking of the Covenant had wounded the world itself. Dragons are bound to magic in ways humans are not. As the covenant weakened, as the balance tilted, we found our eggs would not hatch, our young would not thrive. One by one, we faded. The Elders decided that we must retreat, must hide, must wait for a time when the Covenant could be restored.\"\n\nThe vision showed dragons flying toward distant mountains, disappearing into deep caverns, curling up in forgotten places to sleep a sleep that might last forever. Kira watched them go, felt the sorrow of an entire species facing extinction.\n\n\"I was young then,\" Azurath said, \"barely able to fly. The Elders chose me for a sacred duty—I was to remain awake, to watch and wait, to search for signs that the Covenant could be renewed. They placed upon me a great magic, extending my life far beyond natural span, and they gave me this.\"\n\nThe vision focused on a single scale, larger than the others, positioned directly over where a dragon's heart would be. It glowed with an inner light, pulsing with power. Carved into its surface were the same runes that had covered the ancient covenant stone.\n\n\"The Heart Scale,\" Kira breathed.\n\n\"Yes. It contains the essence of the Covenant, all the accumulated wisdom of the Dragon Elders, and the key to awakening those who sleep. I have carried it for three hundred years, hiding in the deepest mountains, emerging only to search for what I needed to find.\"\n\n\"What did you need to find?\"\n\n\"A new Old One,\" Azurath said. \"The ancient power has faded from humanity, true, but it is not gone. It surfaces rarely, in individuals who have the gift. The Old Ones could speak with metal and stone, could ask them to take new shapes. They were the first metalshapers. And you, Kira Stormwind, have that gift. I have felt it calling across the mountains for months now, growing stronger as your skill developed.\"\n\nThe vision began to fade, and Kira found herself back in the village square, her hand still pressed against Azurath's scales. Tears were streaming down her face, though she didn't remember starting to cry.\n\n\"Why show me this?\" she asked. \"I'm just an apprentice blacksmith. What can I possibly do?\"\n\nAzurath's eye held hers, and there was something ancient and knowing in that gaze. \"I am dying, child. The wound you see was dealt by a darkhunter—a creature that should not exist, born of the imbalance that has poisoned the world. It carries a venom that no dragon can survive. I have days at most. But the mission cannot die with me. The world needs the Covenant restored, or worse things than one wounded dragon will come.\"\n\n\"I don't understand. How do I restore a covenant made thousands of years ago?\"\n\n\"The Heart Scale must be taken to the three sacred places: the Peak of First Flight, the Chasm of Deep Waters, and the Cave of Long Sleep. At each location, you must perform a ritual to awaken that aspect of the Covenant. When all three are complete, the covenant stone will reactivate, and the sleeping dragons will wake. Balance will return.\"\n\nKira shook her head, overwhelmed. \"But I don't know where these places are! I don't know the rituals! I'm not a mage or a scholar or a—\"\n\n\"The Heart Scale contains all the knowledge you will need,\" Azurath interrupted gently. \"But it cannot be carried by just anyone. It must bond with a metalshaper, must become part of you. Only then can it guide you, teach you, protect you.\"\n\n\"Bond with me? What does that mean?\"\n\nThe dragon's breathing was labored now, the silver blood flowing more freely from the wound. \"I will place the Heart Scale upon you, and it will merge with your skin, becoming part of your body. You will carry the weight of my people, but you will also carry our strength. The scale will make you more than you were—faster, stronger, able to understand the speech of dragons and to survive in places that would kill an ordinary human.\"\n\n\"That sounds...\" Kira struggled for words. \"That sounds like it will change me.\"\n\n\"It will,\" Azurath agreed. \"You will no longer be entirely human, but not dragon either. Something between. Something new. I will not lie to you, child—the transformation is painful, and the burden is heavy. But I have searched the world over, and you are the only one with both the gift and the heart to do what must be done. I see it in you—the strength, the determination, the deep goodness. You are the one.\"\n\nKira looked around the square. Villagers were huddled in doorways, watching fearfully. She saw Master Gareth, saw her younger brother Finn peeking",
