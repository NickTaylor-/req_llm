                "text": "The wind, a constant companion in the craggy peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, sang a mournful tune through the ancient pines. Elara, a girl barely eighteen, shivered, pulling her worn cloak tighter. Her life in the isolated village of Oakhaven had been one of quiet routine – tending the small garden, assisting the elder Lyra with her herbal remedies, and listening to the fantastical tales of dragons that Lyra spun by the hearth. Tales, Elara had always believed, were just that: tales. Until now.\n\n**Chapter 1: The Whispers of Wyrmwood**\n\nOakhaven was nestled in a valley, a pocket of green amidst the grey stone. Its people lived simple lives, their greatest fear not the occasional bandit, but the forgotten legends of the Sky-Serpents – dragons. Lyra, with her silver hair and eyes that held the wisdom of centuries, was the village's only link to the wider world, and its history. She spoke of a time when dragons soared freely, not as monsters, but as guardians, their magic intertwined with the very fabric of Aethelgard.\n\nOne crisp autumn morning, the sky, usually a serene azure, bled into a bruised purple. A guttural roar, unlike any sound Elara had ever heard, tore through the air, rattling the very stones of Oakhaven. Panic erupted. Villagers scattered, seeking shelter in cellars and under sturdy tables. Elara, however, felt an inexplicable pull towards the sound. Lyra, her face grim, grabbed her arm. \"It begins, child. The Shadow stirs.\"\n\nAgainst Lyra's warnings, Elara found herself scrambling up the treacherous path to Wyrmwood Ridge, the highest point overlooking the valley. What she saw there froze her blood. A creature of nightmare, its scales the color of obsidian, its eyes glowing with malevolent crimson, tore at the ancient ward-stones that protected Oakhaven. This was no guardian. This was a destroyer. As it unleashed a torrent of black fire, melting stone into slag, Elara saw something else – a smaller, struggling form tangled in the roots of a colossal oak, directly in the path of the dragon's next attack.\n\nWithout thinking, Elara ran. She reached the small creature, a dragon hatchling, no bigger than a large hound, its scales a dull, smoky grey. Its wing was pinned, a desperate whimper escaping its throat. The obsidian dragon roared, turning its terrifying gaze upon her. In that moment, a blinding flash of light erupted from Elara's hand – a pure, golden energy that repelled the dark fire, pushing the monstrous dragon back a few paces. It shrieked, a sound of frustrated rage, before launching itself into the sky, disappearing into the bruised clouds.\n\nElara collapsed, her body trembling, the golden light fading from her hand as quickly as it had appeared. The hatchling, freed, nudged her gently, its large, intelligent eyes blinking. It let out a soft chirp, then nuzzled her hand. A bond, ancient and profound, sparked between them. \"You're... you're a dragon,\" Elara whispered, awestruck. \"And you saved me.\"\n\nBack in Oakhaven, Lyra found her, the hatchling curled protectively at Elara's side. Lyra's expression was a mix of fear and profound understanding. \"The prophecy,\" she murmured, touching Elara's forehead. \"The Dragon Speaker. You bear the mark, child. The gift of the ancient ones.\" She looked at the hatchling. \"And you, little one, are a sign. A spark of hope in the encroaching darkness. What shall you name him?\"\n\nElara thought of the golden light, the fire in its eyes, the warmth emanating from its small body. \"Ignis,\" she decided. \"Fire.\"\n\n**Chapter 2: The First Flight and the Whispers of Kaelen**\n\nNews of the dark dragon's attack spread, carried by terrified merchants who dared to traverse the mountain passes. They spoke of a creeping blight, of corrupted beasts, and of a sorcerer named Kaelen, who sought to bend the ancient magic of Aethelgard to his will. Kaelen, they said, was hunting dragons, not to kill them, but to twist them into instruments of his power.\n\nLyra, now more mentor than elder, began to train Elara. She taught her the true history of Aethelgard, of the Dragon Lords who once communed with the great beasts, and of the Heart of Aethelgard – six Dragonfire Shards, each imbued with the essence of an elemental dragon, scattered across the land after a cataclysmic war. These shards, Lyra believed, were the only hope to combat Kaelen and restore balance.\n\nIgnis grew at an astonishing rate. Within weeks, he was the size of a pony, his smoky scales beginning to shimmer with hints of deep crimson. He"
