Now, let's see, what tools do I have... `get_weather`? Ugh, completely irrelevant. Looks like I'm going to have to do this all from scratch, creatively. Alright, here's how I'll do this:\n\nFirst, let's think of some jokes. Cat jokes are pretty easy â€“ gotta go for something simple, something classic, the kind of thing that elicits a groan. My first thought was a pun: *Why don't cats play poker? Too many cheetahs.* (Meh, a little weak.) How about a joke about kitten behavior? *What do you call a pile of kittens? A meow-ntain.* (That's...okay.) Ah, I know! What about a pun based on \"tail\"? *Why are cats bad storytellers? Because they only have one tail.* (Not bad, but maybe a bit obvious.)\n\nOkay, I think I've got one. Here's a real classic: *What do you call a cat that gets everything it wants? Purr-suasive.* (A simple pun, but I like it!)\n\nNow, let's deliver this clearly and concisely. Let's go with the classic: *Why don't cats play poker in the jungle? Too many cheetahs!* That should do the trick. Done!\n",
