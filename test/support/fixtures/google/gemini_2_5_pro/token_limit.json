                "text": "The world had forgotten the taste of magic. It lingered only in the bitter tang of blighted soil and the whispers of old wives' tales told to frighten children. In the kingdom of Aeridor, dragons were the stuff of those tales—creatures of fire, greed, and ruin, slain by valiant knights in a bygone age of glory.\n\nIn the small, secluded village of Oakhaven, nestled against the gnarled roots of the Dragon’s Tooth Mountains, Elara was a tale unto herself. She was a girl woven from whispers and sideways glances. Her eyes were the colour of moss after a rain, and she spoke more to the wind in the trees than to any of her fellow villagers. They said she was fey-touched, that the wildness of the mountains had seeped into her bones. She would spend her days wandering the ancient woods, her hands tracing the patterns in bark and stone, feeling a faint, humming energy that no one else seemed to notice.\n\nHer only real treasure was a stone she’d found as a child in a stream bed. It was the size of her palm, smooth and dark, but when held to the light, it shimmered with the deep, molten bronze of a dying sunset. It was always warm to the touch, a secret heat that soothed her on cold nights.\n\nThe trouble began as a creeping sickness. The edges of the fields turned grey, the leaves on the mighty oaks curled and blackened, and a strange, silent dust settled over everything. The Whispering Blight, the elders called it, a curse from the mountains. And as fear soured the air, the villagers’ suspicion turned to Elara. Her strangeness, her affinity for the wild places, was no longer a harmless eccentricity. It was a sign. She was the cause.\n\nThe day they came for her, the sky was a bruised purple. The village elder, a man whose face was a roadmap of grim certainties, pointed a trembling finger. \"The blight follows you, girl. You are a canker in our midst. Go back to the mountains that spawned you!\"\n\nCast out, with only the clothes on her back and the warm stone clutched in her hand, Elara did not weep. A strange pull, a resonance she had felt her entire life, now screamed at her from the jagged peaks. The bronze stone in her hand grew hotter, a beacon in the encroaching twilight. She followed its call, climbing higher than any villager dared, into the heart of the Dragon’s Tooth.\n\nThe path was treacherous, leading her to a vast, hidden caldera, a wound in the mountain’s peak. At its centre was a cave, a gaping maw that seemed to exhale ancient sorrow. Hesitantly, she entered. The air grew warm, thick with the scent of ozone and old stone. And there, in the gloom, she saw him.\n\nHe was a living mountain of bronze scales, coiled in a slumber that seemed as old as the rock around him. He was magnificent and terrible, far grander than any story had described. One great, golden eye, slitted like a cat's, cracked open, fixing on her with an intelligence that stole her breath. A deep scar, a patch of jagged, missing scales, marred the perfection of his chest, right over where his heart would be.\n\nA voice, not of sound but of thought, rumbled through her mind, a landslide of ancient weariness and scorn. *“What little morsel has stumbled into my tomb? Have the years grown so short that even the sheep have learned to climb?”*\n\nElara, instead of screaming, felt a pang of empathy. She saw not a monster, but a creature of immense pain and loneliness. She held up the bronze stone. \"I think… this belongs to you.\"\n\nThe great eye widened. The mental voice softened, a tremor of disbelief running through it. *“My heart-scale. Lost in the last great betrayal. How…?”*\n\nHe uncoiled slowly, his size filling the cavern, his head lowering until his snout was mere feet from her. She could feel the furnace-heat of his breath. He was Ignis, the last of the Bronze Guardians, and the stone was a piece of him, shed in a battle against the very men who had once been his allies.\n\nHe told her of the true history, not the one written in the books of men. Dragons were not destroyers; they were the wardens of Aeridor’s lifeblood, the ley-lines of magic that flowed through the earth. They had worked in partnership with a select few humans, the Dragon Riders, to keep the land in balance. But men grew greedy. A sorcerer-king named Malakor, seeking to control the magic for himself, had turned the people against their guardians. He led a slaughter, using dark, twisted"
