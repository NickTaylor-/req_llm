                "text": "The world had forgotten the roar of dragons. It was a sound that lived only in the brittle pages of books and the hushed whispers of grandmothers. The sky, once a canvas for their fiery artistry, was now a placid, empty blue. In the small, sleepy village of Oakhaven, nestled in the shadow of the formidable Cinderpeak Mountains, a young woman named Elara was one of the few who still listened for the echoes.\n\nElara was not a warrior or a mage. She was an apprentice to the village Lore-Keeper, Master Valerius, a man whose spine was as bent as the ancient oaks he loved, and whose mind was a library of forgotten tales. Her days were spent in the dusty quiet of his cottage, mending book-spines, re-inking faded maps, and tracing the elegant, thorny script of the Old Tongue. It was in these texts that she met the dragons. She learned their names, their colors, the histories of their great broods. She felt a kinship with these magnificent creatures, a profound sense of loss for a world she had never known.\n\nThe change began subtly. A patch of wilted grass in a meadow that should have been lush. A stream that ran sluggish and grey. A strange, creeping silence in the woods, as if the very birdsong was being smothered. Master Valerius called it the Blight. A creeping sickness of the land itself, a phenomenon not seen for a thousand years, since the Age of Dragons ended.\n\nOne evening, as a feverish sweat beaded on his brow, Valerius pressed a small, leather-bound roll into Elara's hand. \"The maps lie,\" he rasped, his voice thin as cobwebs. \"The mountains are not empty. Follow the sun's last tear. Find the heart of the mountain. The world needs its fire back.\"\n\nHe passed before the dawn. The Blight had taken him. Grief was a cold stone in Elara's chest, but his last words were a spark in the darkness. She packed a small bag with dried fruit, a waterskin, and the most detailed map of the Cinderpeaks she could find. The roll Valerius gave her was not a map of ink, but of intricate silver thread stitched into blackened leather. It depicted no known landmarks.\n\nFor three days, she climbed. The air grew thin and sharp, and the Blight was more pronounced here. Entire swathes of ancient pines were skeletal and grey, their needles turned to dust. The ground was cracked and sterile. On the third evening, as the sun bled its last orange light across the western peaks, a single beam lanced through a notch in the rock, striking a sheer cliff face. Elara remembered the words: *the sun's last tear*.\n\nAs the light hit the rock, faint lines of silver thread, identical to her map, glowed in the stone. It was a door, sealed by time and magic. Tracing the pattern with a trembling hand, she spoke the only word of greeting she knew in the Old Tongue, a word for a respected elder: \"Skaarsgard.\"\n\nWith a groan that shook the very bones of the mountain, the rock face ground inwards, revealing a cavernous darkness that smelled of ozone, stone, and something ancient and wild. Lighting a small tallow lamp, Elara stepped inside.\n\nThe cavern was vast, a cathedral of stone. But it was the chamber's occupant that stole her breath and rooted her to the spot. Curled in the center, asleep, was a dragon. He was immense, larger than any building in Oakhaven. His scales were the color of polished obsidian, but deep within them, a faint, embers-like light pulsed with each slow, thunderous"
