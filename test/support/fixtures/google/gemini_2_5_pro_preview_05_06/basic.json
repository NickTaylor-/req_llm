It's *the* phrase. We all know it, it's almost a rite of passage. It's probably the first thing anyone types when they're learning a new language, a kind of test to make sure everything's set up right.\n\nSo, let's look at the intent. Are they just saying hi? Probably. Testing me? Possibly. Giving a little wink to the programming community? Absolutely. They're not looking for some deep, philosophical answer, right? No, keep it straightforward. They're expecting a simple, friendly response with a slight nod to the 'hello world' tradition.\n\nOkay, let's keep it clean: \"Hello! How can I help you today?\" Perfect.\n",
