Now, the user wants me to show my *thinking* on how I got there, in a brief, digestible way.  I've got a few options in my mental toolbox.\n\nDirect recall is possible; I just \"know\" 12 x 7.  However, that doesn't really show the process.  So, I need to break it down. Decomposition, that's the ticket!  It's the most transparent method for this situation.\n\nHere's how I'd present it:  \"I break the bigger number (12) into easier parts: 10 + 2. Then I distribute the multiplication: 10 x 7 = 70. And 2 x 7 = 14.  Finally, I sum those products: 70 + 14 = 84.\"  That's clean, step-by-step, and it highlights a fundamental multiplication strategy.  This decomposition approach is efficient for mentally solving multiplication.  Perfect. That's the core of how I'd demonstrate my thinking.\n",

That's easy: 70.\n    *   Next, I multiply the 2 by 7. That's 14.\n3.  **Add Them Together:** I add the two results: 70 + 14 = 84."
