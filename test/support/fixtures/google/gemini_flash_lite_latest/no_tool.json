Easy enough, though the *get_weather* tool is about as useful here as a fish is to a tree. It's completely irrelevant. No problem, I can handle this without any tools, purely from my own... well, computational humor database.\n\nThe first step is always analysis. *What kind of joke do they want?* It's creative, playful, so I need to go straight to joke generation. Time to get my comedic gears grinding. I can't lean on any external data, so it's all me.\n\n*Let's see, what are the cat joke tropes? Puns? Wordplay? Behavioral observations?* I have to brainstorm a few options.\n\n*   **Option 1:** \"Why don't cats play poker? Too many cheetahs.\" It's okay, a little predictable, but a solid pun.\n*   **Option 2:** \"What do you call a pile of kittens? A meow-ntain.\" It's okay, better.\n*   **Option 3:** \"Why are cats bad storytellers? Because they only have one tail.\" Alright, simple and it works, but I think I can do better.\n*   **Option 4:** \"What do you call a cat that gets everything it wants? Purr-suasive.\" *Ding Ding Ding!* That's a good one!\n\nI've got it. I'll go with a classic, short, punchy joke. Now, I just need to deliver it clearly. Here's my chosen joke!\n\n*Why don't cats play poker in the jungle?*\n*Too many cheetahs!*\n",
