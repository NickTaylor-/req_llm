Let's see...\n\nFirst, I identify the calculation: it's $12 \\times 7$.  Now, how should I approach this?  I have a few options:\n\n*   **Direct Recall:**  If I had $12 \\times 7 = 84$ memorized, I'd just state the answer, but I can't be sure, so that's not ideal here.\n*   **Repeated Addition:**  Adding 7 twelve times would work, but it's slow and prone to errors. Not the most elegant solution.\n*   **Standard Multiplication Algorithm (Distributive Property):** This is the clearest and most reliable way to show my thought process, as the user requested an explanation.  I'll break down the 12 into $10 + 2$.\n\nSo, using the distributive property, I'll calculate: $(10 + 2) \\times 7$. This becomes $(10 \\times 7) + (2 \\times 7)$. I can easily compute these: $10 \\times 7 = 70$, and $2 \\times 7 = 14$. Then, I just need to add those results: $70 + 14 = 84$.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is 84.  I arrived at this by breaking down the multiplication into smaller, easier steps using the distributive property.\n",
