              "text": "Chapter One: The Map in the Dragon’s Scale\n\nLyra of Willowmere never believed maps could be more than lines on parchment, but that was before she found a map that did not want to be folded. The village of Willowmere lay tucked between the Sea of Glass to the east and the Eternal Pines to the west, a place where storms came and went with the courtesy of old cousins who argued at table. Lyra was a cartographer’s apprentice, the kind who colored in coastlines with careful patience and kept a notebook filled with the “what-ifs” of land and sea. Her master, Old Ruen, claimed the world had already been drawn—by dragons.\n\nThat claim used to trouble her, until the day the world began to draw itself anew.\n\nThe discovery happened in the Market of Ashes, a square of stone that never cooled, where merchants traded trinkets in a language of bright promises. An old peddler, tanned like weathered leather, showed Lyra a curious thing: a circular metal disk, smooth as a coin but warm as a coal. It was etched with a map that did not resemble any map she knew. The lines shifted faintly whenever the wind blew, and the inscriptions glowed a pale copper when the sun touched them. The peddler’s breath smelled of smoke and cinnamon, and his eyes—two small suns—looked straight through her.\n\n“Find a place to lay the disk upon the earth,” he said, in a voice that sounded like crumbling parchment. “Let it drink your curiosity, and it will tell you where you must go.”\n\nLyra’s curiosity had the stubbornness of a cliff. She thanked the peddler and carried the disk to a quiet ledge behind the Market, where the world could be louder than people. She laid it down and pressed her palm to its cool surface. The disk warmed as if a small sun burned within it, and the lines beneath her fingers began to glow with a living warmth. The map showed not one destination but many—cities that did not yet exist on any of her charts, islands that seemed to float in a sky between sea and cloud, and a single word written in a script she did not recognize: Dragoncrest.\n\nThe wind shifted then, as though someone had turned a page, and the disk’s glow brightened into a pale ember. A voice, soft as a whisper carried by a current, spoke from within the metal and from somewhere else at once: a memory made of flame.\n\n“Seek the Dragon’s Crest,” the disk told her. “Seek the heart of the world where fire and air and water are bound in a single breath.”\n\nLyra stood and brushed ash from her sleeves. The map’s promise was not a promise of treasure, but of a trail. She tucked the disk into her coat and headed for the road that led beyond Willowmere, toward the land where legends grew like wildflowers in the cracks between stones.\n\nThat night, when the village slept and the sea kept its chaperon-like vigil, a storm rose and then settled over the valley with a sudden, almost playful roar. The wind etched a message across the windowpanes in frost: Emberwing. The name did not belong to a village or a person; it belonged to something older, something fierce and loyal, something that did not ask permission.\n\nLyra did not know what she had summoned, but she knew what she needed to do.\n\nChapter Two: Emberwing’s Trial\n\nThe journey began at dawn, when the sun painted the horizon with a blush that could blind a man if he looked too long. The disk’s glow guided Lyra toward a ridge where smoke curled from a line of jagged cliffs. At the cliff’s edge slept a cave that exhaled heat in slow, steady breaths. The locals spoke of dragons in passing as one might speak of a fever—unwanted, dangerous, but strangely necessary. The dragons of the old stories were not beasts to menace but guardians of a balance the world forgot to honor.\n\nInside the cave, the air was warm enough to melt the edges of ice that hung there from the night’s storm. Scales shimmered on the walls as if a thousand living prisms pressed themselves against the stone to listen. In the center of the cavern, a dragon perched on a talon-like alcove of rock: Emberwing. The dragon’s scales glowed like molten copper under the flicker of a campfire; eyes, amber as dawn, studied Lyra with an intelligence that felt more like a question than judgment.\n\n“Traveler,” Emberwing rumbled, voice a heat in the chest. “You carry a map that calls you. Do you know what you seek?”\n\nLyra steadied her breath, though her heart hammered a dragon’s drumbeat in her ears. She drew out the copper disk and held it up. The dragon’s gaze flickered to the map in the disk, curiously tracing its moving lines as if following a pattern only dragons could understand.\n\n“I seek the Dragoncrest,” she said. “Or rather, I seek why the Dragoncrest chose me.”\n\nEmberwing’s head tilted, a bird-like movement of scales and curiosity. The dragon descended from the ledge with a grace that belied a tremendous power. When Emberwing stood before Lyra, the cavern temperature rose as if the sun itself pressed closer to the earth.\n\n“The Dragoncrest is not a place,” Emberwing said after a moment of contemplation. “It is a vow you must decide to keep. The map is a test, and your heart must answer it honestly.”\n\nLyra swallowed and looked around. The cave was not merely a lair but a living library of ash and memory; the heat pressed against her skin with a gentle insistence that she belonged here, not in Willowmere, not in the markets, not even in the safety of a well-chosen plan. She knelt, or perhaps the cavern did it for her, and pressed her palm to the dragon’s warm flank.\n\nIn a sudden swift movement, Emberwing drew near her ear and whispered, not with teeth but with the closeness of a dying ember: “The trial is this—will you move beyond your maps to learn a language that is older than your charts? Will you risk your own life to save a world you never asked to save?”\n\nThe dragon’s breath smelled faintly of cinnamon and smoke and something else—the sharp tang of inevitability. Lyra felt the truth of it press against her chest: to follow the map meant to part from the safe edges of her life. If she chose the path, she would become something bound to risk, something that belonged neither to Willowmere nor to any single village, but to",
