            "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I need to solve 12 multiplied by 7. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that multiplication is essentially repeated addition, so 12 times 7 is like adding 12 seven times. But that might take a while. Maybe there's a quicker way.\n\nAlternatively, I can break down the numbers into smaller parts. For example, 12 can be split into 10 and 2. So, 10 multiplied by 7 is 70, and 2 multiplied by 7 is 14. Then, if I add those two results together, 70 plus 14, that should give me the total. Let me check that: 70 plus 10 is 80, and then plus 4 more makes 84. So, 12 times 7 is 84. Wait, does that make sense? Let me verify using another method to be sure.\n\nAnother way is to use the distributive property. So, 12*7 = (10 + 2)*7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84. Yep, that matches. Maybe I can also think of it as 7*12, which is the same thing because multiplication is commutative. If I do 7*10, that's 70, and 7*2 is 14, then add them together. Still 84. Hmm, seems consistent.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in addition. 70 plus 14. Let's add the tens first: 70 has 7 tens, and 14 has 1 ten and 4 ones. So, 7 tens plus 1 ten is 8 tens, which is 80, and then the 4 ones make it 84. Yep, that's correct. I think that's the right answer. No, I don't think I made any errors here. Both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that 12 multiplied by 7 equals 84.\n",
