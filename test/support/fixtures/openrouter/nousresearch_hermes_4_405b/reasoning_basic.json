            "reasoning": "\nAlright, let's see. I need to solve 12 multiplied by 7. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling how multiplication works. Multiplication is essentially repeated addition, right? So 12 times 7 means adding 12 seven times. Let me write that out to visualize it better.\n\nFirst, if I add 12 four times: 12 + 12 = 24, then 24 + 12 = 36, and 36 + 12 = 48. That's four times. Then I need to add 12 three more times to reach seven. So continuing from 48: 48 + 12 = 60, 60 + 12 = 72, and 72 + 12 = 84. Wait, so that's 12 added seven times, which totals 84. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the addition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking it down into parts would help. I know that 10 times 7 is 70, and 2 times 7 is 14. If I add those two results together, 70 + 14, that should give me the same answer. Let's do that: 70 + 14 is 84. Yep, that matches the previous result. So both methods give me 84. That seems right. I don't think I made any errors here. Let me just confirm with another method, like using the standard multiplication algorithm.\n\nMultiplying 12 by 7: 7 times 2 is 14, carry over the 1. Then 7 times 1 is 7, plus the carried 1 makes 8. So writing that down gives 84. All three methods lead to the same answer. I think that's solid. No mistakes noticed here. The answer should be 84.\n",
