Hmm, I remember that multiplication is just repeated addition, so 12 times 7 is the same as adding 12 seven times. But doing that manually might take a while. Maybe there's a quicker way.\n\nWait, I recall the distributive property from math class. That's where you break down numbers into smaller, more manageable parts. Let me try that. Let's break down 12 into 10 and 2. So, 12 * 7 becomes (10 + 2) * 7. Then, using the distributive property, that would be 10*7 + 2*7. \n\nCalculating each part separately: 10 times 7 is 70, and 2 times 7 is 14. Adding those together, 70 + 14 equals 84. So, 12*7 should be 84. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe another method. I know that 10*7 is 70, and 2*7 is 14, so adding them gives 84. Alternatively, I could think of 12*7 as 7*12, and since multiplication is commutative, that's the same thing. \n\nAlternatively, using the times table: 7 times 12. Let's count by 12 seven times. 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84. Yep, that's seven steps, so the result is 84. \n\nWait another way: 12*7. If I know that 10*7 is 70, then adding 2 more 7s (which is 14) gives 70+14=84. All methods seem to confirm that the answer is 84. I think that's correct. Let me just verify with a calculator. 12*7=84. Yep, that's right. Okay, I'm confident now.\n",
