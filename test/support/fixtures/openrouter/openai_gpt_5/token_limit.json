            "content": "The first time Kessa heard a dragon’s heartbeat, the mountain grove itself seemed to lean in to listen. The rhythm was slower than any creature she’d known, vast and distance-eating, as if sound were a river and the heart was pulling it upstream. She had found the egg by accident, a stone of bronze and dusk-silver lodged beneath a curtain of roots. The sky above the grove had been bruised with thunderheads; rain thread through the pine needles; somewhere, a woodpecker hammered away at fate. Kessa set a trembling hand to the egg and felt its warmth, a living heat that was deeper than weather.\n\n“Don’t,” whispered the roots, or perhaps it was the rain. But Kessa refused to be warned by things that didn’t wear names. She pushed aside the curtain of roots and brought the egg into the open, laying it on her cloak, out of the drip-line. The ground shivered. Not an earthquake—this was the quiver of something waking within the world. She glanced at the lines of her palm, at the scars earned from holding back the river when it rose, at the faint burn marks from a torch that slipped in the square last winter. She had always been the sort of girl to pick up strange stones and carry them home.\n\n“Don’t,” said her friend Derro, catching up through saplings, wet hair splashing his cheeks. He was a healer’s apprentice, a careful boy with careful hands. He skidded to a stop and stared. “Kess, if that’s what I think—”\n\n“It doesn’t matter what you think,” she said, feeling giddy with it. “Help me keep it warm.”\n\nThey wrapped the egg in their cloaks and hunched over it, two bodies making a shelter. The rain took pity and eased, the woodpecker quieted as though listening.\n\nWhen the shell broke, it did not crack so much as peel, flaking like ash. A small dragon lifted its long head from the ashes of its own making. Its eyes were blue. Not the sky-blue of Kessa’s village steps. Not the river-blue which, in flood time, turned brown. This was the blue of a flame’s core. The hatchling’s frill shook and droplets disappeared on its skin, steaming away from the heat. It regarded Kessa and Derro without fear, then touched its snout to Kessa’s wrist. Heat scarred her instantly. She swallowed a yell because the dragon was laughing—or that’s how it sounded, a chime like hammered glass.\n\n“Named,” Derro whispered. “You’ve been named.”\n\nKessa held her burned wrist against her chest and stared at the dragon. “Named by whom?”\n\nThe dragon chirred. The sound reverberated in Kessa’s bones. The answer stood in her head like a word she didn’t recognize in a language she knew by heart. The dragon’s name was Ashender, which was also a wind that blew over hot sand and a song that old women hummed after funerals. In naming Kessa, Ashender had braided their lives into a length of rope that could climb cliffs—or lower her into darkness.\n\nAs they snuck out of the mountains, Kessa kept the dragon under her cloak, where he radiated a warmth that felt like hearth-fire and home. Derro kept glancing at the singe spreading from Kessa’s wrist up her forearm. “You need salve,” he murmured, “something cooling. The burn’s strange—no blistering, just the skin changing.”\n\n“It’s a mark,” Kessa said. “It’s a promise.” And she smiled until her face hurt, even as she imagined her mother’s mouth tightening when she saw what Kessa had brought back.\n\nThey reached their village at twilight. The crooked houses huddled together like gossiping old men on market day. Smoke climbed out of holes in roofs, pointing out places where supper warmed. A bell tolled twice from the steeple, an old iron tongue calling people to the square.\n\nThe square—not a good sign. Tithes or trouble.\n\nThey slipped along the alley by the weaver’s workshop, moving past vats of dye that gave off a smell as thick as a story. Kessa’s sopping cloak dripped into a puddle that mirrored the world upside down, and for a heartbeat she saw her reflection with eyes as blue as Ashender’s. She almost tripped.\n\nAt the square, folk gathered. They made space around someone who stood above them on the steps of the Hall, a figure cloaked in red and gray. Kessa took in the shape of him, the quiet of his stance, and felt a coldness that Ashender’s heat couldn’t touch.\n\nAn Inquisitor. And not just any—this one wore the badge of an Iron Scribe: a shard of mirror backed with a coil of iron, meaning he collected truths and bound them like books. Kessa had heard of Iron Scribes who wrote down the last words of dying kings, of ones who took the true names of rivers and scrawled them under lock and key so they could be bartered for bridges.\n\n“People of Stoneford,” the Inquisitor said, voice smooth as rain on slate. “I am Scribe-Justiciar Halves, here under the crest of the Regent. A matter of safety brings me. Dragons have been sighted along the mountain winds. You understand what this means.”\n\nQuiet murmurs. The old bowed their heads. The children widened their eyes. Derro pressed close to Kessa. Under her cloak Ashender trembled, not with fear, but with awareness, the way fire trembles when wind prowls.\n\n“Dragons,” the Inquisitor continued, “are language made flesh. They speak with blood and bone and weather. Left untamed, they break bargains. They unmake oaths. We must keep them from binding themselves to those unfit for their duty. The Regent requires all villages to present any sign of dragoncraft. Eggs, scales, scorchmarks, strange marks upon the skin. Do not fear. We will take them to the Eyries, where trained hands will tend them. Bring us your burdens, and we will lift them.”\n\nKessa felt her burned wrist throb. She remembered a rumor her aunt had told, of a village that gave up a clutch of eggs and never saw spring rain again. She remembered a story about a dragon who folded herself into a teacup to hide from those who would chain her. She thought of her father’s ashes, scattered when the river took him: everything precious wants to run.\n\n“Run,” Ashender whispered in her mind, a little voice that burned its way through. “Run now, rope-sister.”\n\nDerro squeezed her hand. “We can go to the north road,” he breathed, eyes on the Inquisitor. “I’ll tell them you went west. I’ll tell your mother—”\n\nKessa shook her head. “No,” she said, and it surprised her that she meant it. “I’m done with sneaking. If I run now, they’ll set dogs on the whole village. I need to leave in such a way that no one else pays the price.”\n\n“How?”\n\nKessa took a breath, then stepped out into the square. She lifted her chin, feeling the dragon under her cloak press closer, as if to anchor her to her own bones. “Scribe-Justiciar Halves,” she called. Her voice only shook a little. “If you’ve come for dragons, then you’ve come for me.”\n\nThe crowd split like a river around a rock. The Inquisitor’s gaze found Kessa and held. The mirror-shard on his breast caught the dying light and sliced it, casting lines of brightness across her face. He was not old, not young—ageless in that terrible way of scribes who bind themselves to their work until they have no season left. His eyes were the gray of parchment.\n\n“And who are you?” he asked.\n\n“Kessa. Stoneford-born. River-hold. I found a dragon. He found me.”\n\nShe drew back her cloak. Ashender lifted his head, snow of steam pluming from his nostrils. He was small still, but his presence thickened the air. The Inquisitor’s expression did not change, but the soldiers behind him shifted their weight, a shimmer of armor like distant rain.\n\n“It appears you have,” Halves said. “Then you’ll come with me.”\n\n“No,” Kessa said. “I’ll leave, yes. I’ll take the north road and never come back until I can come back without endangering anyone. But I won’t go with you to your Eyries. I know what happens there. You break their names.”\n\nAt that, the Inquisitor smiled, and Kessa decided she preferred him stern. “Names are chains or bridges, child. It depends on who holds them and how they are used.”\n\nA murmur fluttered across the square. Kessa didn’t move. Her heart hammered, beating time with Ashender’s. Derro, at the edge of the crowd, looked like a man trying to remember whether he could breathe.\n\n“Let’s test whose hands are careful,” Kessa said, surprising herself again with her voice steady. “I challenge you to Truth.”\n\nThe square gasped like something pulled from water. The Inquisitor’s eyes narrowed. “Are you certain you want that game, girl?”\n\n“You wear a mirror,” Kessa said. “I have a dragon. Let the truth choose which way it looks.”\n\nHe studied her, then nodded once. “Truth, then. Three questions each, straight and sharp, answered without twist. If one lies, the lie is marked. If one answers poorly, the poor answer will pull them for a year. If one refuses to answer, they cede the claim.”\n\nAshender flowed to her shoulder, claws pricking lightly. He hummed under her skin like a hive. The Inquisitor lifted the mirror shard from his chest. Kessa saw her face in it; the mirror showed her grin as braver than she felt.\n\n“First question,” Halves said. “Do you believe you can protect your village by defying me?”\n\nKessa almost said yes. The word hung on her tongue like a weight. Ashender’s hum sharpened, a reminder that truth wasn’t the same as courage. “No,” she said, and the mirror breathed out a long sigh. “Not by defying you right now in this way. You could take anyone you wanted from here, and no one could stop you.”\n\n“Good,” Halves said with something oddly like approval. “Your turn.”\n\n“Will you harm my village if I leave quietly?” Kessa asked.\n\n“No,” he said, and the mirror stayed still. “Not if you leave quietly. My quarrel is not with the village. It is with what dragoncraft can become when left to burn its own path.”\n\nThe next questions cut closer and were answered with tight faces and a careful dance around the facts, but neither lied, and neither refused. At the end, Halves let the mirror settle against his chest and spread his hands, the gesture of one who has invoked a law and is bound by it. “Leave, then. Tonight. The world beyond the north road is not kind. You will not like its lessons.”\n\nKessa nodded. “Probably not.”\n\nHe paused. “I expect to see you again, girl Kessa. With your dragon. Most people who sit at the fire with their fear later bring it a bowl and call it a guest.”\n\nKessa did not say what she thought of people who made hunger their master. Instead she turned, and Derro was there, face white as flour. “I packed already,” he said, thrusting a bundle into her hands. “Herbs. Bandages. A jar of sweetmilk. My mother’s bread without salt; it keeps. And a set of five needles. You could trade those for a horse, if a horse were ever foolish enough to be bought by needles.”\n\nShe tried to hug him and kept jostling Ashender’s tail. They managed something that was more like a tangle of limbs and laughter and dripping cloaks, and then Kessa was walking out of the square, past faces she had known all her life, every blessing and curse threaded together in the eyes of those who watched. At the edge of the village, she glanced back once. The Inquisitor stood tall and still, like a mark on a page that meant more than itself.\n\nShe left by the north road.\n\nThe world beyond did not like her at first. The road climbed into lands that kept their bones close to their skin. Hills steeped themselves in wind, and whatever trees had survived the last fire stood sullen and black-stubbled along the ridges. Wanderers traded news in campfireside murmurs. Kessa learned the sound of wolves that were just wolves and the howls of steppe-spirits who meant to draw the reckless off the path. She learned how to sleep with one ear awake. She learned that Ashender preferred to curl around her throat in the cold, a scarf of living heat that hummed secrets to the underside of her jaw.\n\nThey came to Thornbridge, a town cobbled together with stubbornness and nails. The central arches were woven of wicker and iron; the inn was called The Seventh Candle and had five burnt-out stubs glued to its sign. The innkeeper, a moody woman with the brisk kindness of someone who had no patience for cruelty, took one look at the dragon and put them in the loft.\n\n“Keep the heat up there,” she said. “We just got the rafters repaired, and I’d like to keep them wood.”\n\nAshender made the lamps jealous. His breathing turned the air warm enough for Kessa to sleep without shivering, for once. In the morning, before she woke, he slunk out to",
