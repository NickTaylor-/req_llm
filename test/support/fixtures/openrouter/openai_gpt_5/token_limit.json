            "content": "The first time Aisha heard the dragons, she was thirteen and the river was singing in the reeds.\n\nThe villagers of Thatchmere called it a trick of the wind. They told stories at the low tavern tables, leaning over bowls of nettle soup, about a time when there had been no wind and the dragons themselves kept the breezes moving with their wingbeats. Those were green and terrible days, the elders said, full of thunder and fire, when a flight of ember-drakes could darken the sun and a storm-dragon might turn and look at you with the sky inside its eye. Then the Great Treaty was made, and the dragons flew to their mountains, and people built their lives around the missing sound, and everyone slept easier.\n\nBut down by the reeds, when the river licked the bank with its cold, moss-scented tongue, Aisha heard songs that echoed inside her bones and threaded through the black hairs on her arms. They came in three threads—silver, smoky, and green—and she would sit with her boots off, toes in the silt, and hum along, forgetting the basket of laundry at her side and the wet shirts that needed wringing. The songs said simple things at first. Milkwort. Raindust. Updraft. A language of actions and air. Once in a while a tremor of a deeper note would run through, a rumble you could taste as much as hear, and then her heart would pound and the laundry would slip from her fingers. What had the elders said? Never sing to the sky. But her mouth, traitor that it was, would open anyway.\n\nWhen strangers came through Thatchmere, hawkers and tinkers with wares on their backs, Aisha could tell the dragons were nearby from the way the strangers stood and listened before they entered the village square. Most folks heard nothing and went on, but some stopped and tilted their heads, as if a distantly familiar lullaby had found them again. Aisha watched them with interest and, once, with sudden daring, asked a woman with a blue scarf if the song meant anything to her.\n\n\"It means someone is calling and someone else is almost answering,\" the woman said, not unkindly, and flipped a coin to her, as if she had paid for the question. The coin was old, stamped with a dragon that had two tails. Later, Aisha would learn that such coins came from the Skyspires, the tallest mountains east of anywhere, where the wind curled like a cat and the stones remembered the footprints of winged things. Later, she would hold those Skyspires in her mouth like a tasted word and dream of them. Now, she was just a girl and the summer stretched long, and the river sang and she sang with it.\n\nThe Great Treaty had conditions. The first was that humans must never go higher than the King’s Mile—no villages, no farms, no firewood gathering up there, nothing that took root in dragon territory. The second was that no dragon would descend below the Old Willow line—a ring of ancient trees, half dead and half clinging on around the base of the mountains—on pain of exile. The third was that the Heartstone, largest and brightest of the sky-pearls that formed in the moony places where dragon nests were built, would remain locked in the Treaty Tower, an empty lighthouse on the northern cape, guarded by the Dawnkeepers who took no wives, no husbands, and no names. It was told that the Heartstone pulsed when a human child was born of a true-voice, a rare one who could speak or sing with the dragons, and that was a sign to the Dawnkeepers to send their cloaked emissaries down and take the child away to be trained. It was further told, by those who liked telling, that the last true-voice child had been born twenty years ago and had vanished into the white, and that the Dawnkeepers did not know the difference between training and consumption.\n\nAisha did not think she was a true-voice. She only sang to the river for company. She was an orphan; her mother had danced herself into the river in the carve of grief left by her father's illness. She lived with Aunt Morna, who said little and baked bread that tasted like a promise kept. She had chores and she shirked them; she had friends and she loved them; she had a knife and a length of rope and a pair of boots too big for her that she would fill with rolled wool in winter. The future came like fog in the mornings, shifting shapes she could not quite make out.\n\nThen came the storm.\n\nIt arrived without thunder. The air went still as if listening to something far away. Then a greenish shadow fell and stretched and lengthened, until the fields reflected the color of bruises. Aisha had an armload of fresh bread, warm through the cloth; she stood in the doorway of Aunt Morna’s bakery and watched as the wind came back in a different mood, like a friend returning late and loud and half drunk. Branches thrashed. The iron sign creaked, then groaned, then broke. A thatch of straw went cartwheeling like birds. Aisha saw at least three hats take flight.\n\n\"Down!\" Aunt Morna shouted, and the word whipped away. Aisha saw her aunt stumble, and reached for her, but then the unseen thing roared over the village and around it and through it, and Aisha realized, in a sudden clarity that braided together all her days, that the roar was not wind at all but a voice, and it was in pain.\n\n\"A torrent,\" gasped Aunt Morna, face white, as they crouched under the very solid old oak table. \"What is a torrent doing this far down?\"\n\nAisha had never heard of a torrent by any meaning but rain. \"A dragon?\"\n\n\"A storm-drake,\" Aunt Morna said tightly. \"They call the weather around them. To fly is to make wind; to fold your wings is to demand stillness. A torrent like this is a dragon forcing wind to obey. We haven't seen that in twenty years.\" A crumb clung to Morna's lower lip. Aisha watched it as if the tiny piece of bread might somehow anchor her to an ordinary world.\n\nThe roaring passed. Silence came back, heavy as a bruising hand. In the stunned quiet that followed, the horse in the stables began to whine, and somewhere a baby cried, and from the church came the frantic peal of bells. Aisha rose, bread forgotten. She stepped out into the square. The green thickness was fading, leaving the real colors beneath it exposed like a secret. People wandered out of their houses too, dazed. The cobbler held both his shoes and one of his wife's. The Dawnkeepers, if they still existed, stayed hidden.\n\nThen the river spoke, and not in song. It spoke with urgency, with consonants like pebbles. Aisha stood with her mouth open. Nobody else was listening. The river said: Swift. Fallen. North. It said: Cannot lift. It said: Help.\n\n\"Do you hear it?\" Aisha asked the cobbler, but he was looking at his shoes, calculating and sorrowing. She looked at Aunt Morna. Aunt Morna was wiping flour off the broken sign with the care an old woman gives to relics. Aisha was barely aware of her own body as she began to run.\n\nThe north path cut through alder and birch, their white trunks like parentheses holding conversations of leaves. The river ran beside her, brown and fast, showing her, between its tumbling reflections, flashes of something not itself. A black shape, tangled, not moving. A torn wing like a fallen tent. A pale crest like a piece of sky on the ground.\n\n\"Where?\" Aisha demanded, and her voice cracked and blew away, and she forgot to be afraid. The river, who had no patience for time the way humans did, who was always beginning and ending at once, said simply: Arrive.\n\nShe arrived at a bend where the bank had undercut into a brown cave. A willow leaned over, its long green hair trailing. In the shallow, thrashing post-storm water lay a dragon.\n\nAisha did not think that was possible. Dragons lived in stories. But here was a body like the curvature of a hillside, like a forest moving. Its scales were the matte green of wet stones laced with veins of pallor. Its wing stretched into the water, half submerged, making small waves as it trembled. A bicycle of broken ribs showed through. Its head was as long as the bakery, filigreed with spines like frost patterns on a window and a crest that would light if lit. Its eye was closed. Its nostrils pulsed. Its foreclaw dug into the muddy bank in a way that made Aisha’s own fingers ache.\n\nShe approached. She was shaking, from fear, yes, and something else, something like standing at the edge of a precipice and recognizing that jumping is not necessarily falling. She had no idea what to do. She had a knife, rope, bread she had dropped somewhere. \"I am Aisha,\" she said, absurdly, to the dragon. She said, less absurdly, \"Do you understand me? Are you hurt?\"\n\nThe dragon opened its eye. In the narrow almond of that eye were skies, and within those skies were smaller skies, and within those, storm-lines and bird flights and something like language. It gazed at her with concentration and then, to her surprise, closed its eye again. It turned its head slightly—oh so very slightly; even that tiny movement shifted the water in waves—and breathed out. She heard a word, not with ears but in the little bones that remember what it is to be fish. \"Yes,\" said the dragon.\n\nShe saw then what held it. Its tail, long and muscular and finished with a fin like a feather, had twisted in a jumble of flood-wood and snagged in the roots of the willow. The willow, stubborn old thing, had clenched like a fist around it. Every time the dragon pulled, the roots cut deeper. Where the roots bit, the green scales had split and the under-skin was a luminous grey, slick with dragon-blood. The blood smoked a little when it met air, smelling like burnt cinnamon.\n\n\"I'll cut you free,\" Aisha said. Her hands, without her permission, reached for her knife. The blade, everyday and blue with age, suddenly looked small and bright. A sight line ran through her like a piece of string, from knife to root to tail to wing to the whole sky.\n\n\"No,\" said the dragon. \"You cannot. The roots will spring back around your arm. Then you will be caught, and I will have to choose between chewing off your hand and letting us both die.\" The eye opened again, and something like a smile moved under it. \"You are very small.\"\n\n\"Is there a better plan?\" Aisha asked, insulted and practical.\n\n\"The willow will listen to song,\" the dragon said. \"It loves hoarded things. If you sing it a story full of old treasures, it will loosen. You have the voice to bind. I heard you in the bend of storms. Sing what it wants.\"\n\nAisha almost laughed. \"What could I sing that a tree could want?\"\n\nThe dragon's eye closed and opened again in a slow blink. \"Everything,\" it said.\n\nShe thought of the villagers, of Aunt Morna, of the cobbler's one shoe, of the baby crying. She thought of the coin with two tails. She thought of her mother dancing herself into the river and of how the river had whispered afterwards that it was not its fault. She thought of bread: the way flour takes water and changes irrevocably, the way heat asks dough what kind of creature it wants to be. She thought of her own knife, the inherited feel of its handle, and of rope, and of stars in a pond that no one else noticed. And a story came to her mouth that was not a story, a song that had no up or down, and she sang.\n\nShe sang of winter apples with frost on their skins, and a child biting into one and finding summer inside. She sang of a goose feather quill that had written the letter that had kept a war from happening. She sang about a grandmother's ring, glass really, but kept for seventy years and never chipped. She sang about the highway that had not been built through a field because someone had seen a fox there one morning and had changed her mind. She sang about steam lifting from a",
