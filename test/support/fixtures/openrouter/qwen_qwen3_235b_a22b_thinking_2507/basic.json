Maybe add a bit of humor related to coding since they used that phrase. Let me check if there's a standard response for this.\n\n\"Hello, World!\" is often the first thing you print when learning a new language. So I can mention that. Also, offer help if they're starting to code. Keep it welcoming and encouraging.\n\nMake sure the tone is positive and supportive. Avoid any technical jargon since they might be beginners.
