            "reasoning": "\nOkay, the user asked me to solve 12 times 7 and show my internal thinking briefly. Hmm, this seems like a straightforward multiplication problem, but they specifically want to see the thought process—not just the answer. \n\nFirst, I wonder why they're asking. Maybe they're a student learning basic math, or perhaps someone testing how I approach simple calculations. Since they said \"brief,\" I should keep it concise but still meaningful. \n\nI recall that 12×7 is a common multiplication fact. One way to break it down is using distributive property: 10×7 + 2×7. That's 70 + 14 = 84. Alternatively, doubling 6×7 (which is 42) would also give 84. But the first method feels more intuitive for mental math. \n\nWait—should I mention other methods? Nah, they said \"brief,\" so I'll stick to the clearest approach. Also, no need to overcomplicate; this is likely for foundational understanding. \n\n*Double-checking*: 7+7+7... twelve times? Too tedious. Yep, distributive is best. And 84 is correct—I know 12×6=72, so 72+12=84. Solid. \n\nUser didn't specify context, but since it's basic arithmetic, I'll assume clarity > depth. No signs of frustration or urgency in the query, so neutral tone is fine. Just deliver the logic cleanly. \n\nFinal plan: State method, show steps, give answer. Keep it under 3 lines.\n",
