I'll keep it open-ended to encourage them to ask questions or share what's on their mind. Make sure to use a smiley to keep it warm. Let me phrase it like, \"Hello! ðŸ‘‹ How can I assist you today?\" That sounds good. Wait, the user might be looking for help with something specific, but since they just greeted, I shouldn't assume. Just a standard friendly reply. Yeah, that's right.\n",
