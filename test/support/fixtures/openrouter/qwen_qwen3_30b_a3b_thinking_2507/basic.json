Maybe add a smiley to keep it warm.\n\nWait, they might be new to interacting with AI, so I should make sure my response is clear and not too technical. Just a simple, cheerful reply.\n\nAlso, check if they need help with anything specific. Since they said \"Hello world!\", maybe they're just starting out, so offering assistance would be good.\n\nLet me make sure the response is in English, as the query is in English. No need for any complex terms. Keep it short and approachable.\n\nSo, something like: \"Hello! ðŸ˜Š How can I assist you today?\"\n\nWait, the user's message is \"Hello world!\" so maybe they're referencing the programming term.
