            "reasoning": "Okay, the user asked me to solve 12 times 7 and show my internal thinking briefly. Let me start by recalling multiplication basics. 12 times 7... I know that multiplication is repeated addition, so 12 added seven times. But that might take too long. Maybe breaking it down is better.\n\nHmm, 10 times 7 is 70, right? And 2 times 7 is 14. Then adding those together: 70 + 14. Let me check that. 70 plus 10 is 80, plus 4 more is 84. Yeah, that makes sense. Alternatively, I could think of 12 as 6 times 2, so 6 times 7 is 42, then double it to 84. But the first method seems more straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe another way: 7 times 10 is 70, 7 times 2 is 14, sum is 84. Yep, same result. Should I consider using the distributive property? Yes, exactly. 12*7 = (10+2)*7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 +14 =84. That's correct.\n\nLet me verify once more. 12*7. If I add 12 seven times: 12+12=24, +12=36, +12=48, +12=60, +12=72, +12=84. Yep, same answer. So all methods confirm 84. The user just wants a brief explanation, so focusing on the distributive approach might be the quickest. So, splitting 12 into 10 and 2, multiplying each by 7, adding the results. That's efficient.\n",
