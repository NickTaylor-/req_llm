Maybe say something like \"Hello!\" or \"Hi!\" to match their tone. Since they used \"Hi there!\", which is a bit casual and cheerful, I can respond in a similar way.\n\nI should also consider if there's anything else they might need. But since they just said hi, probably just a simple greeting is enough. Maybe add a smiley emoji to keep it warm. Like ðŸ˜Š\n\nWait, but sometimes people might have a follow-up question. So after greeting, I can ask how I can help them today. That way, it's open-ended and invites them to share what they need.\n\nSo possible response: \"Hello! ðŸ˜Š How can I assist you today?\" That sounds good. Let me check if that's appropriate. Yes, it's friendly, professional, and offers assistance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ What can I do for you today?\" But the first one is fine. Let's go with \"Hello! ðŸ˜Š How can I assist you today?\" That's standard and helpful.\n",
