So 12 times 7 is the same as adding 12 seven times. Let me check that: 12 + 12 is 24, plus another 12 is 36, then 48, 60, 72, and the seventh one would be 84. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down using the distributive property. Maybe 12 is 10 plus 2, so 10*7 = 70 and 2*7 = 14. Then adding those together: 70 + 14 = 84. That's quicker. \n\nI could also use the multiplication table I know. 7 times 10 is 70, and 7 times 2 is 14, so 70 + 14 again gives me 84. \n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 12*7... if I count by 12s: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84.
