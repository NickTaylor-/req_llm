The available functions are limited to getting weather, so no, this doesn't match.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If the user's query can be addressed using an available function, and all required parameters are provided or obviously inferable, trigger a function call.\" In this case, it cannot be addressed using any available function.\n\nFurther, it says: \"Ask for clarification only if none of the provided functions are able to advance the user's request.\" Since no functions can advance this request, I shouldn't ask for clarification unless it's unclear, but this is clear—it's just not something I can handle.\n\nThe instructions also emphasize: \"Keep your response to user clear; please do not make your response verbose!\" So, I should be direct.\n\nMy response should not include any function calls because there's no relevant function. I need to inform the user that I can't help with that or suggest what I can do, but without being verbose.\n\nPossible response: I could say something like, \"I'm sorry, I can't tell jokes, but I can help with weather information. What location would you like the weather for?\"\n\nHowever, the instructions don't specify to promote other functions, but since that's all I have, it might be appropriate to steer the conversation.\n\nTo keep it simple: Just respond that I can't assist with that.\n\nRe-reading the instructions: \"If there is anything unclear, ask the user for clarification.\" But here, it's clear what they want, it's just not something I can do.\n\nThe best action is to politely decline and perhaps mention what I can do.\n\nFinal decision: Do not use <function_call> tags.
