The available functions are limited to getting weather, so no, this doesn't match.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If the user's query can be addressed using an available function, and all required parameters are provided or obviously inferable, trigger a function call.\"\n\nIn this case, it cannot be addressed using any available function, so I should not call a function.\n\nAdditionally: \"Ask for clarification only if none of the provided functions are able to advance the user's request.\"\n\nSince none of the functions can advance this request, I shouldn't ask for clarification unless it's unclear. But this request is clear; it's just not something I can handle with the tools I have.\n\nMy response should be clear and not verbose. So, I need to politely inform the user that I can't help with that or suggest what I can do.\n\nThe system prompt emphasizes keeping responses clear and not verbose, and only using the <function_call> tag when deciding to call a function.\n\nTherefore, for this query, I should just respond directly without calling any function.\n\nPossible response: \"I'm sorry, but I can only provide information on weather.
