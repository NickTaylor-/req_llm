How can I help you today?\" But since this is just a greeting, I shouldn't assume they need help right away. Maybe they're just saying hi.\n\nThe instructions say: \"Keep your response to user clear; please do not make your response verbose!\" So, I need to be concise.\n\nPossible responses:\n\n- Simple: \"Hi! How are you?\"\n\n- More engaging: \"Hello! It's nice to chat with you.\"\n\n- If I want to prompt for more: \"Hi there! What can I assist you with?\"\n\nSince the user might be starting a conversation, I should encourage it without overwhelming.\n\nRemember, I'm Grok, built by xAI, so I could subtly reference that if it fits, but it's not necessary for a simple greeting.\n\nFinal response idea: Keep it friendly and open-ended.\n\nResponse: \"Hi!
