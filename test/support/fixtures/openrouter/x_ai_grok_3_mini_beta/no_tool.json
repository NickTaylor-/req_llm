The available functions are limited to getting weather, so no, this doesn't match.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If the user's query can be addressed using an available function, and all required parameters are provided or obviously inferable, trigger a function call.\" In this case, it cannot be addressed using any available function.\n\nFurther, it says: \"Do not call a function if no matching functions apply or if parameters are missing/unclear. Ask for clarification only if none of the provided functions are able to advance the user's request.\"\n\nSince none of the functions can advance this request, I should not call a function. Instead, I should respond directly or ask for clarification if needed. But the query is clear; it's just not something I can handle with the tools I have.\n\nThe instructions emphasize keeping responses clear and not verbose. So, I should simply respond that I can't help with that or suggest something else if appropriate.\n\nMy response should be helpful. I could say something like: \"I'm sorry, but I don't have the capability to tell jokes. I can help with weather information if you'd like.\"\n\nThat way, I'm redirecting to what I can do.\n\nFinally, ensure that I don't use the <function_call> tag unless I'm actually calling a function.
