            "reasoning": "First, the user asked to solve 12 * 7 and show my internal thinking briefly. I need to calculate this multiplication.\n\nI know that multiplication is repeated addition. So, 12 multiplied by 7 is the same as adding 12 to itself 7 times. Let me do that: 12 + 12 = 24, 24 + 12 = 36, 36 + 12 = 48, 48 + 12 = 60, 60 + 12 = 72. After adding 7 times, I get 72.\n\nI could also think of it as 10 times 7 plus 2 times 7. 10 * 7 = 70, and 2 * 7 = 14, so 70 + 14 = 84. That doesn't seem right. 12 is 10 + 2, so (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84. But earlier I got 72, which is inconsistent. I must have made a mistake in the addition.\n\nLet me recount the addition: Start with 0. First 12: 12. Second 12: 12 + 12 = 24. Third 12: 24 + 12 = 36. Fourth 12: 36 + 12 = 48. Fifth 12: 48 + 12 = 60. Sixth 12: 60 + 12 = 72. Seventh 12: 72 + 12 = 84. I missed one addition. When I added the seventh 12, I should have 84. But in my first attempt, I stopped at the sixth addition, which was 72, but that's only six 12s. I need seven 12s.\n\nSo, correctly: 12 + 12 = 24 (2), +12 = 36 (3), +12 = 48 (4), +12 = 60 (5), +12 = 72 (6), +12 = 84 (7). Yes, 84. I miscounted the steps initially.\n\nUsing the distributive property: 12 * 7 = (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84. That matches.\n\nI also know that 12 * 7 is a basic multiplication fact. From memory, I recall that 7 times 12 is 84. For example, 7 * 10 = 70, 7 * 2 = 14, 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nAnother way: 12 * 7. I can compute 10*7=70, and since 12 is 2 more than 10, add 2*7=14 to 70, which is 84.\n\nOr, 12 * 5 = 60, and 12 * 2 = 24, so 60 + 24 = 84. That works too.\n\nSo, all methods confirm that 12 * 7 = 84.\n\nNow, the user wants to see my internal thinking briefly. So, I should outline this process concisely.\n\nInternal thinking:\n\n- Recognize that 12 * 7 means 12 added 7 times.\n\n- Calculate step by step: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84.\n\n- Alternatively, use distributive property: (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84.\n\n- Verify with known facts or other methods.\n\n- Conclude that 12 * 7 = 84.\n\nKeep it brief, as specified.\n\nFinally, present the answer clearly.",
