One way to think about it is to add 12 seven times, but that might not be efficient. I can break it down using the distributive property.\n\n12 times 7 is the same as (10 + 2) times 7. Because 10 + 2 is 12, and then distributing the 7: so 10 times 7 plus 2 times 7.\n\n10 times 7 is 70, and 2 times 7 is 14. Then, 70 plus 14 is 84.\n\nI could also think of it as 7 times 12. 7 times 10 is 70, and 7 times 2 is 14, again 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nAnother way is to recall that 12 times 5 is 60, and 12 times 2 is 24, so 60 + 24 = 84. But that might be more steps.\n\nSince 7 is close to 5 or 10, but I think the first method is simplest.\n\nI should show the steps in my thinking. So, internally:\n\n- Recognize that 12 × 7.\n\n- Break 12 into 10 and 2.\n\n- Multiply 10 by 7: 10 × 7 = 70.\n\n- Multiply 2 by 7: 2 × 7 = 14.\n\n- Add the results: 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nTherefore, the product is 84.\n\nNow, for the response, I need to present this briefly as per the user's request.\n\nAlso, make sure it's clear and step-by-step.\n\nFinally, box the answer as is common in such problems.",
