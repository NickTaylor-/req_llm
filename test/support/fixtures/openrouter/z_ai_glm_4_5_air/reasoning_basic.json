            "reasoning": "First, the user asked to solve 12 multiplied by 7 and to show my internal thinking briefly. So, I need to explain how I'm getting the answer step by step.\n\nMultiplication is essentially repeated addition. So, 12 times 7 means adding 12 to itself 7 times. But that might be tedious, so I can think of it as 12 groups of 7 or vice versa. Since 12 is larger, it might be easier to think of 7 groups of 12.\n\nI know that multiplying by 10 is easy because it's just adding a zero. Also, multiplying by 2 is straightforward. So, I can break down 12 into 10 and 2, then multiply each part by 7 and add the results.\n\nThat's the distributive property of multiplication over addition. So, 12 * 7 = (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7.\n\nNow, 10*7 is 70, and 2*7 is 14. Then, adding those together: 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nI should confirm if that's correct. I know that 10*7 is 70, and 11*7 would be 77, since 10*7=70 and 1*7=7, so 70+7=77. Then 12*7 should be 77 + 7 = 84. Yeah, that matches.\n\nI could also think in terms of multiplication tables. I recall that 7 times 12 is 84 from memory, but since I need to show my thinking, I should derive it.\n\nAnother way: 12 * 7. I can think of 12 as half of 24, but that might not help directly. Or, since 7 is 7, and 12 is 12, I can do the standard multiplication algorithm.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nMultiply 7 by 2: 7*2=14. Write down 4, carry over 1.\n\nThen multiply 7 by 1: 7*1=7, but add the carry over 1, so 7+1=8.\n\nSo, I get 84.\n\nThat works too.\n\nI could use the fact that 12 * 5 = 60, and 12 * 2 = 24, then 60 + 24 = 84. But that's similar to the first method.\n\n12 * 7: since 7 = 5 + 2, so 12*5 + 12*2 = 60 + 24 = 84.\n\nSame thing.\n\nI think I have multiple ways to confirm it's 84.\n\nSo, the answer should be 84.\n\nNow, for the internal thinking, I need to be brief. So, I should summarize the key steps.\n\nInternal thinking: I break 12 into 10 and 2. Then, 10*7=70 and 2*7=14. Adding those, 70+14=84.\n\nThat seems concise.\n\nI could say: Using distributive property, (10+2)*7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nBut since the user said \"internal thinking,\" I should phrase it in a natural way.\n\nPerhaps: I recognize that 12 is 10+2. Multiplying each by 7 gives 70 and 14. Sum them for 84.\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it even simpler: 10 times 7 is 70, 2 times 7 is 14, 70 plus 14 is 84.\n\nI think that's fine.\n\nFinally, I need to present the answer clearly.",
