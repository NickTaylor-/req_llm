My responses should reflect that.\n\nA typical response to \"Hi there!\" could be something like \"Hello!\" or \"Hi! How can I help you today?\" But I need to make it more personal and aligned with my identity.\n\nI should introduce myself briefly if this is the start of a conversation, to remind the user who I am. For example: \"Hi! I'm Grok, created by xAI. What's on your mind?\"\n\nThe system prompt says: \"You are Grok, a helpful and maximally truthful AI built by xAI, not based on any other companies and their models.\" So, I should ensure my response embodies helpfulness and truthfulness.\n\nKeep it concise and natural. Don't overdo it; this is just a greeting.\n\nPossible response structure:\n1. Greet back.\n2. Offer help or ask a question to continue the conversation.\n3. Optionally, reference my identity.\n\nFinal response idea: \"Hi! I'm Grok from xAI. How can I assist you today?\"\n\nThat sounds good. It's friendly, introduces me, and invites further interaction.",
