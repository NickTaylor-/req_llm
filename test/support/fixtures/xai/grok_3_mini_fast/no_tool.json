The only available function is \"get_weather\", which is for getting weather information based on a location.\n\nI need to check if this query can be addressed using the available functions. The available functions are limited to getting weather, so no, this doesn't match.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If the user's query can be addressed using an available function, and all required parameters are provided or obviously inferable, trigger a function call.\"\n\nIn this case, it cannot be addressed using the available functions, so I should not call any function.\n\nAdditionally: \"Ask for clarification only if none of the provided functions are able to advance the user's request.\"\n\nSince none of the functions can advance this request, I shouldn't ask for clarification unless it's unclear. But this request is clear; it's just not something I can handle with the tools I have.\n\nMy response should be kept clear and not verbose. So, I need to politely inform the user that I can't help with that or suggest what I can do.\n\nThe system prompt emphasizes: \"You are only permitted to use the <function_call> tag in your response only if you have made the decision to call a function.\"\n\nSince I'm not calling a function, I should just respond normally.\n\nPossible response: I could say something like, \"I'm sorry, but I can only provide information on weather. If you have a question about the weather, let me know!\"\n\nThat keeps it clear and direct.",
