From the system prompt, I know that I have access to tools like this. The available tools are:\n\n- add: Adds two numbers and returns the result.\n\nSo, I should use the add tool with the arguments 2 and 3.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"You can use the following tools by writing a function call in your response: ... add: Adds two numbers and returns the result.\"\n\nTo use it, I need to write a function call in my response. The format is: \"{% your function call here %}\".\n\nFor example: { \"action\": \"add\", \"action_input\": { \"num1\": 2, \"num2\": 3 } }\n\nAfter using the tool, I have to wait for the result and then respond with 'sum=<value>'.\n\nThe instructions say: \"After the tool result arrives, respond with 'sum=<value>'.\"\n\nIn this simulation, I need to output the function call first, and then, assuming the tool runs, I respond based on that.\n\nBut in my response, I should only output the function call, and the system will handle the rest. However, the user is asking me to compute it and then respond.\n\nRe-reading the user's message: \"Use the add tool to compute 2 + 3. After the tool result arrives, respond with 'sum=<value>'.\"\n\nSo, my immediate response should be the function call to the add tool.\n\nOnce the tool result arrives (which in this context, I might need to simulate or assume), I respond with 'sum=<value>'.\n\nIn the conversation flow, I think I need to output the function call in my first response.\n\nThe system prompt ends with: \"Make sure to use this exact format for function calls: { \"action\": \"action_name\", \"action_input\": { \"param1\": value1, ... } }\"\n\nSo, for my response, I should output something like:\n\n{ \"action\": \"add\", \"action_input\": { \"num1\": 2, \"num2\": 3 } }\n\nThen, presumably, the tool will execute and return the result, say 5, and then I can respond with 'sum=5'.\n\nSince this is a single interaction, I need to handle it in one go, but based on the prompt, I should just make the function call.\n\nThe user says: \"After the tool result arrives, respond with 'sum=<value>'.\" So, in my next message, I do that.\n\nIn this setup, as an AI, I might need to output both, but I think the proper way is to output the function call first.\n\nPerhaps in this exercise, I should output the function call, and then assume the result and output the final response.\n\nTo be precise, let's think about how these tools work. In many AI frameworks, when you call a tool, the response is handled separately.\n\nFor this response, I should start by calling the tool.\n\nMy response should be: { \"action\": \"add\", \"action_input\": { \"num1\": 2, \"num2\": 3 } }\n\nAfter that, once the tool returns, say 5, I would respond with 'sum=5'.\n\nSince this is a simulated conversation, I need to provide the full answer.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"Remember to always use the following format for tool usage:\"\n\nAnd then it shows the format.\n\nIt also says: \"Keep your response to user clear; please do not make your response verbose!\"\n\nSo, for this, my initial response should just be the function call.\n\nTo match the user's instruction, I need to ensure that after the tool, I respond as specified.\n\nPerhaps in this context, I can output the function call, and then immediately the response, but that might not be accurate.\n\nAnother way: maybe I should output only the function call in my response.\n\nLet's check the user's message again: \"Use the add tool to compute 2 + 3. After the tool result arrives, respond with 'sum=<value>'.\"\n\nI think the expectation is that I use the tool, and then in a subsequent step, respond.\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, I'll output the function call.\n\nSo, my response: { \"action\": \"add\", \"action_input\": { \"num1\": 2, \"num2\": 3 } }\n\nThen, assuming the tool returns 5, the final response would be 'sum=5'.\n\nSince the user is asking me to respond with that after, perhaps in this message, I just do the call.\n\nI need to make it clear.\n\nPerhaps the AI is expected to handle it in one response for this simulation.\n\nTo be safe, I'll follow the format and output the function call.\n\nFinal decision: My response should be the JSON for the function call.",
