After the tool result arrives, respond with 'sum=<value>'.\"\n\nI need to understand what the \"add tool\" is. From the context, it seems like this is part of a system where I can use tools. In this setup, I'm an AI that can call external tools, and one of them is probably an \"add\" tool that performs addition.\n\nThe instruction is to use the add tool to compute 2 + 3. So, I should call that tool with the arguments 2 and 3.\n\nAfter the tool result arrives, I have to respond with 'sum=<value>', where <value> is the result from the tool.\n\nIn my response, I shouldn't just say the answer directly; I need to wait for the tool's result and then format it as specified.\n\nHow do I actually use the tool? In this simulation, I think I need to indicate that I'm calling the tool. Perhaps in the response, I should output something like a tool call.\n\nLooking at the system prompt or previous interactions, it might be that I use a specific format to call tools. For example, in some AI setups, you use JSON or a specific syntax to invoke tools.\n\nAssuming this is similar to models like Grok, I might need to use a format like:\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"add\",\n  \"action_input\": {\"a\": 2, \"b\": 3}\n}\n\nThen, after the tool runs, I get the result and respond accordingly.\n\nThe user said: \"After the tool result arrives, respond with 'sum=<value>'.\" So, my immediate response should be the tool call, and then once the result is available, I respond with the formatted string.\n\nIn this chat, I need to output my response step by step.\n\nPlan:\n\n1. Call the add tool with inputs 2 and 3.\n\n2. Once I have the result, say 5, then respond with 'sum=5'.\n\nSince this is a simulated environment, I'll assume that when I call the tool, the result is immediately available for this exercise.\n\nThe add tool should simply return 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo, my response should first be the tool call, and then the final response.\n\nThe user instructed: \"Use the add tool... After the tool result arrives, respond with 'sum=<value>'.\"\n\nI need to make sure my final output is just 'sum=5', but perhaps in this interaction, I have to show the process.\n\nRe-reading the system prompt: \"You can use the following tools by writing a function call like this: <function_call>{ \\\"name\\\": \\\"tool name\\\", \\\"arguments\\\": { ... } }</function_call>\"\n\nOh, yes! So, I need to use that exact format.\n\nTo call the add tool, I should output:\n\n<function_call>\n\n{\n\n  \"name\": \"add\",\n\n  \"arguments\": {\n\n    \"a\": 2,\n\n    \"b\": 3\n\n  }\n\n}\n\n</function_call>\n\nAfter that, the system will execute it and provide the result, say 5, and then I can respond with 'sum=5'.\n\nIn this single response, I might need to include both, but based on the prompt, I think I just output the function call, and the next step handles the response.\n\nThe user said: \"After the tool result arrives, respond with 'sum=<value>'.\" So, in my next message, I should do that.\n\nFor now, my immediate action is to output the function call.\n\nFinally, once I have the result, I output: \"sum=5\"\n\nIn this chat, I need to simulate it.\n\nPerhaps in this exercise, I should output the function call in my response.\n\nLet me think about what to write.\n\nMy response should be:\n\nFirst, the function call.\n\nThen, assuming the result, but I think I only output the function call now.\n\nThe system might handle it sequentially.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll output the function call as per the format.\n\nSo, my final output for this turn: The function call for the add tool.",
