            "reasoning_content": "\nFirst, the user asked to solve 12*7 and show my internal thinking briefly. So, I need to multiply 12 by 7 and then explain my thought process in a concise way.\n\nMultiplication is straightforward: 12 times 7. I know that 10 times 7 is 70, and 2 times 7 is 14. So, if I add those together, 70 + 14, that should give me the answer.\n\nLet me calculate that: 70 + 14. 70 plus 10 is 80, plus 4 is 84. So, 12*7 = 84.\n\nI could also think of it as 12*7. Since 7*12 is the same, and I remember that 7*12 is 84 from the multiplication table. But to show internal thinking, I should break it down step by step.\n\nAnother way: 12*7 means adding 12 seven times. But that might take longer, so breaking it into parts is efficient.\n\nSo, my internal thinking:\n\n- Recognize that 12 can be split into 10 and 2.\n\n- Multiply 10 by 7 to get 70.\n\n- Multiply 2 by 7 to get 14.\n\n- Add 70 and 14 to get 84.\n\nThat seems clear and brief.\n\nNow, for the response, I should state the answer and then include the thinking part as requested.\n\nThe user said \"show your internal thinking (brief)\", so I need to present it in a way that's easy to read.\n\nPerhaps I can say: \"12 * 7 = 84. Internal thinking: I broke 12 into 10 and 2. 10*7=70, 2*7=14, then 70+14=84.\"\n\nThat should be concise.\n\nI could use the distributive property: 12*7 = (10+2)*7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nSame thing.\n\nI think that's fine.\n\nFinal answer is 84.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me confirm: 7 times 12. 7*10=70, 7*2=14, 70+14=84. Yes.\n\nOr, 12*5=60, 12*2=24, 60+24=84. But that's another way, but I think the first one is simpler.\n\nNo need to complicate; the brief thinking is sufficient.",
