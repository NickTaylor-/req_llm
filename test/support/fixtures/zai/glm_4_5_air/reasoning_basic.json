            "reasoning_content": "First, the user asked to solve 12 multiplied by 7 and show internal thinking briefly. So, I need to calculate 12 * 7.\n\nI know that multiplication is repeated addition. So, 12 * 7 means adding 12 seven times. Let me do that:\n\n12 + 12 = 24\n\n24 + 12 = 36\n\n36 + 12 = 48\n\n48 + 12 = 60\n\n60 + 12 = 72\n\n72 + 12 = 84\n\nSo, after adding 12 seven times, I get 84. Therefore, 12 * 7 = 84.\n\nI could also think of it as breaking it down. For example, 10 * 7 = 70, and 2 * 7 = 14, so 70 + 14 = 84. That's a common way to multiply mentally.\n\nSince 12 is 10 + 2, I can distribute the multiplication: (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nAnother way is to use the standard multiplication algorithm. Let me write it down:\n\n  12\n\nx  7\n\nFirst, multiply 7 by 2: 7*2=14, write down 4, carry over 1.\n\nThen, multiply 7 by 1: 7*1=7, plus the carry-over 1, so 7+1=8.\n\nSo, it's 84.\n\nI could also think in terms of doubling or other shortcuts, but for small numbers like this, it's straightforward.\n\nThe user said \"show your internal thinking briefly,\" so I should keep it concise.\n\nSo, my internal thinking:\n\nI recall that 12 times 7. I break it into 10 times 7 is 70, and 2 times 7 is 14, then add them: 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nOr, I add 12 seven times: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84.\n\nBut the distributive property way is probably faster and more efficient.\n\nSince 12 * 7 is the same as 7 * 12, and 7 * 12 might be easier for some, but it's the same.\n\n7 * 12: 7*10=70, 7*2=14, 70+14=84.\n\nNo difference.\n\nI think 84 is correct.\n\nNow, to present it: I need to show the answer and the brief thinking.\n\nSo, final answer: 84\n\nInternal thinking: I used the distributive property: 12 * 7 = (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nThat should be fine.",
