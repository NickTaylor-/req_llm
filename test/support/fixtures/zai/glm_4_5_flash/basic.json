The code runs immediately when executed, printing the greeting.\n\n### Output:\n```\nHello, World!\n```\n\nThis is the classic first program for learning programming languages. It demonstrates basic syntax and output functionality.",

We are to create a program that prints \"Hello, World!\".\n 2. In Python, we can use the print function.\n\n But note: the user might be in a different context? The instruction says to output the code in a markdown code block.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.",
