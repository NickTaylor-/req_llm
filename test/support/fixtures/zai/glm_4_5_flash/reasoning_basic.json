            "reasoning_content": "First, the user asked to solve 12 multiplied by 7 and to show my internal thinking briefly. So, I need to calculate 12 * 7 and explain the steps in a concise way.\n\nI know that multiplication is repeated addition. So, 12 times 7 means adding 12 to itself 7 times. But that might be tedious. There's a better way using the distributive property of multiplication over addition.\n\nI can break down 12 into 10 and 2. So, 12 * 7 is the same as (10 + 2) * 7. Then, using the distributive property, that's 10*7 + 2*7.\n\nNow, 10 times 7 is easy: 10 * 7 = 70.\n\nThen, 2 times 7 is 14.\n\nSo, adding those together: 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nTherefore, 12 * 7 = 84.\n\nI could also think of it as 7 times 12, which is the same thing. 7 * 10 = 70 and 7 * 2 = 14, so 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nAnother way is to use the fact that 12 is 12, and 7 is 7, but that's not breaking it down. Or I could recall that 12 * 5 = 60, and 12 * 2 = 24, then 60 + 24 = 84. But that's similar to what I did.\n\nSince 12 * 7, I might think of it as 10*7 + 2*7, which is what I did.\n\nI think the distributive property is efficient.\n\nNow, for the internal thinking, I need to be brief. So, I should outline the steps clearly.\n\nInternal thinking:\n\n- Break down 12 into 10 and 2.\n\n- Multiply each by 7: 10*7=70, 2*7=14.\n\n- Add the results: 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nSo, the final answer is 84.\n\nThe user said \"show your internal thinking (brief)\", so I should present it in a way that shows the process.\n\nPerhaps I can say:\n\nI know that 12 * 7 can be computed by distributing: 12 * 7 = (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nOr, since multiplication is commutative, 7*12 is the same.\n\nBut I think starting with 12 is fine.\n\nAnother common method is to use the standard multiplication algorithm, but since it's a simple case, it might be overkill.\n\nFor example:\n\n  12\n\nx  7\n\nFirst, 7 * 2 = 14, write down 4, carry over 1.\n\nThen, 7 * 1 = 7, plus carry over 1 is 8, so 84.\n\nThat works too, and it's straightforward.\n\nBut in internal thinking, I should choose the method that makes sense.\n\nSince the user said \"internal thinking\", I should just describe the logic briefly.\n\nI think the distributive property is clear.\n\nLet me formulate the response.",
