            "content": "\n**84**\n\n***\n\n### Internal Thinking:\n\nI'll break down the 12 into two easier numbers to multiply: 10 and 2.\n\n1.  First, I'll multiply `10 * 7`, which is **70**.\n2.  Then, I'll multiply the remaining `2 * 7`, which is **14**.\n3.  Finally, I'll add those two results together: `70 + 14 = 84`.",
            "reasoning_content": "1.  **Analyze the User's Request:**\n    *   **Core Task:** Solve the multiplication problem `12 * 7`.\n    *   **Constraint:** \"show your internal thinking (brief)\". This means I need to not just give the answer, but explain the mental math process I'd use. The \"brief\" part is key - don't write a novel.\n\n2.  **Identify the Mathematical Operation:** It's multiplication.\n\n3.  **Choose a Mental Math Strategy:** There are several ways to break down `12 * 7`. I'll consider a few and pick the one that feels most natural and easy to explain briefly.\n    *   **Strategy 1: Standard Multiplication (like on paper).**\n        *   `7 * 2 = 14`. Write down the 4, carry the 1.\n        *   `7 * 1 = 7`. Add the carried 1, making it 8.\n        *   Result: 84.\n        *   *Critique:* This is reliable, but maybe less \"internal thinking\" and more \"rote algorithm.\" It's a good fallback.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2: Distributive Property (Breaking down one number).** This is a very common and efficient mental math technique.\n        *   Break down 12 into `10 + 2`.\n        *   Multiply each part by 7: `(10 * 7) + (2 * 7)`.\n        *   `10 * 7` is easy: `70`.\n        *   `2 * 7` is easy: `14`.\n        *   Add the results: `70 + 14`.\n        *   `70 + 10 = 80`. `80 + 4 = 84`.\n        *   *Critique:* This is excellent. It's a clear, step-by-step mental process. It's easy to explain and demonstrates a good number sense. This is a strong contender.\n\n    *   **Strategy 3: Distributive Property (Breaking down the other number).**\n        *   Break down 7 into `5 + 2`.\n        *   Multiply each part by 12: `(12 * 5) + (12 * 2)`.\n        *   `12 * 5` is half of `12 * 10`, so that's `60`. (A good mental trick).\n        *   `12 * 2` is `24`.\n        *   Add the results: `60 + 24`.\n        *   `60 + 20 = 80`. `80 + 4 = 84`.\n        *   *Critique:* Also very good. Slightly less common than breaking down the 12, but perfectly valid and shows flexibility.\n\n    *   **Strategy 4: Doubling/Halving.**\n        *   `12 * 7`\n        *   Double one number and halve the other. The product stays the same.\n        *   Double 12 -> 24. Halve 7 -> 3.5. This makes it `24 * 3.5`, which is harder. Bad choice.\n        *   Let's try another way. Let's think of `12 * 7` as `7 * 12`.\n        *   We know `7 * 12` is the same as `7 * (2 * 6)`.\n        *   This is `(7 * 2) * 6`.\n        *   `7 * 2 = 14`.\n        *   Now I have to do `14 * 6`.\n        *   `14 * 6` can be broken down: `(10 * 6) + (4 * 6) = 60 + 24 = 84`.\n        *   *Critique:* This works, but it's a more complex path. It's not as \"brief\" or direct as Strategy 2.\n\n4.  **Select the Best Strategy for the Explanation:** Strategy 2 (breaking 12 into 10 + 2) is the most straightforward, common, and easy-to-explain mental math method. It directly addresses the user's request for \"internal thinking\" in a clear, brief way.\n\n5.  **Draft the Response:**\n    *   Start with the final answer, as that's the primary request.\n    *   Then, add the \"internal thinking\" section.\n    *   Write out the chosen strategy (Strategy 2) concisely.\n    *   Use clear, simple language. \"I'll break 12 into 10 and 2...\"\n    *   Show the steps: `10 * 7 = 70`. `2 * 7 = 14`.\n    *   Show the final addition: `70 + 14 = 84`.\n    *   Review the draft. Is it brief? Yes. Does it show the thinking? Yes. Is the answer correct? Yes.\n\n6.  **Final Polish:** The structure will be:\n    *   Answer: 84\n    *   Internal Thinking section:\n        *   State the strategy: Break 12 into 10 and 2.\n        *   Show the first part: 10 * 7 = 70.\n        *   Show the second part: 2 * 7 = 14.\n        *   Show the final addition: 70 + 14 = 84.\n    *   This looks perfect. It directly answers the user's prompt while fulfilling the \"show your thinking\" constraint briefly and effectively.",
