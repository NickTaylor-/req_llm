It's an opening line.\n\n3.  **Determine the user's intent:**\n    *   They are starting a conversation.\n    *   They are testing the system to see if it's responsive.\n    *   They are just being polite.\n    *   They might be a new user.\n    *   They might not have a specific question yet, but are just \"saying hello\" to get the ball rolling.\n\n4.  **Brainstorm possible responses:** The goal is to be helpful, friendly, and encouraging, while also opening the door for the *real* conversation to begin.\n\n    *   **Simple and direct:**\n        *   \"Hello!\" (A bit too simple, maybe?)\n        *   \"Hi!\" (Same, a bit robotic.)\n        *   \"Hello there!\" (Mirrors their greeting, friendly.)\n\n    *   **Slightly more engaging/friendly:**\n        *   \"Hi! How can I help you today?\" (Classic, effective, gets straight to the point.)\n        *   \"Hello! It's great to hear from you. What's on your mind?\" (A bit more conversational and less transactional.)\n        *   \"Hey there! I'm ready to help. What can I do for you?\" (Uses \"Hey\" which is slightly more casual, but still professional.)\n\n    *   **More elaborate/enthusiastic (might be overkill for a simple \"hi\"):**\n        *   \"Greetings and salutations! Welcome! How may I be of service?\" (A bit theatrical, could be fun but might not be what the user is looking for.)\n        *   \"Hello! It's a pleasure to connect. I'm all ears. What fascinating topic are we going to explore today?\" (Very high-energy, might be a bit much.)\n\n    *   **Combining friendliness with a call to action:**\n        *   \"Hello there! Thanks for stopping by. How can I assist you?\" (Polite, welcoming, and direct.)\n        *   \"Hi! I'm glad you're here. What can I help you with?\" (Expresses pleasure, which is a nice touch.)\n        *   \"Hey! Ready for a chat",
