Then:\n- Multiply 10 by 7: 10 * 7 = 70\n- Multiply 2 by 7: 2 * 7 = 14\n- Add the results: 70 + 14 = 84\n\nThis avoids more complex steps and leverages basic facts for efficiency.\n\n**Solution:** 12 * 7 = 84",
            "reasoning_content": "\nFirst, the user asked to solve 12 * 7 and show my internal thinking briefly. So, I need to multiply 12 by 7.\n\nMultiplication is basic arithmetic. 12 times 7 means adding 12 to itself 7 times, or vice versa. But since it's multiplication, I can just recall the fact that 12 * 7 = 84. I should think step by step to show the internal process.\n\nLet me break it down. I know that 12 * 7 can be thought of as (10 + 2) * 7. That might be easier because multiplying by 10 is simple.\n\nSo, (10 + 2) * 7 = 10 * 7 + 2 * 7.\n\nNow, 10 * 7 = 70.\n\nAnd 2 * 7 = 14.\n\nThen, add them together: 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nI could also think of it as 12 * 7. Since 7 is 5 + 2, but that might not be simpler. 12 * 5 = 60, and 12 * 2 = 24, then 60 + 24 = 84. Same result.\n\nOr, using the multiplication table: 7 times 12. I know 7 * 10 = 70, and 7 * 2 = 14, so 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nAll methods lead to the same answer.\n\nNow, for the internal thinking, I need to show it briefly. So, I should outline the steps concisely.\n\nPerhaps: \"I recognize that 12 * 7 can be broken down as (10 * 7) + (2 * 7). Calculating each part: 10 * 7 = 70, and 2 * 7 = 14. Then adding them: 70 + 14 = 84.\"\n\nSince it's brief, I can say: \"Using the distributive property: 12 * 7 = (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84.\"\n\nThat seems efficient.\n\nI could also mention that I recall the multiplication fact directly, but since the user wants internal thinking, showing the breakdown is better.\n\nFinally, state the answer clearly.\n\nSo, response should be: Internal thinking: Break down 12 as 10 + 2, then multiply each by 7: 10*7=70, 2*7=14, add to get 84. Then, the answer is 84.",
