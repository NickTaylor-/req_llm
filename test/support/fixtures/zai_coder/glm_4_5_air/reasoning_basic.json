            "reasoning_content": "First, the user asked to solve 12 times 7 and show my internal thinking briefly. So, I need to multiply 12 by 7.\n\nI know that multiplication is repeated addition. So, 12 * 7 means adding 12 seven times: 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12. But adding seven times might be time-consuming, so there should be a better way.\n\nI recall the multiplication table. I know that 10 times 7 is 70, and 2 times 7 is 14. Since 12 is 10 plus 2, I can do (10 + 2) * 7.\n\nUsing the distributive property: (10 + 2) * 7 = (10 * 7) + (2 * 7) = 70 + 14.\n\nNow, 70 + 14 is 84. So, that should be the answer.\n\nI can also think of it as 7 times 12. 7 * 10 = 70, 7 * 2 = 14, 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nAnother way: I know that 12 * 5 = 60, and 12 * 2 = 24, then 60 + 24 = 84. But that might be longer.\n\nSince 7 is 5 + 2, but I think the first method is fine.\n\nI should keep it brief, as requested. So, internal thinking: break down 12 into 10 and 2, multiply each by 7, then add the results.\n\n10 * 7 = 70\n\n2 * 7 = 14\n\n70 + 14 = 84\n\nI can also think of 12 * 7 directly. I remember that 12 * 7 is 84 from memory, but I need to show the thinking.\n\nAnother quick way: 12 * 7 = 12 * (10 - 3)? That might be messy. 10 - 3 is 7, but 12 * 10 = 120, 12 * 3 = 36, then 120 - 36 = 84. That works, but it's unnecessary since addition is simpler.\n\nSo, sticking with the distributive property is best.\n\nFinally, the answer should be 84.\n\nNow, to present it: first, state the thinking briefly, then give the answer.",
