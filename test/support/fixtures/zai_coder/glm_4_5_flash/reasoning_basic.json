            "reasoning_content": "\nFirst, the user asked to solve 12 multiplied by 7. That's straightforward: 12 × 7.\n\nI need to show my internal thinking briefly. So, I should explain how I'm doing it in my mind, without making it too lengthy.\n\nI know that multiplication is repeated addition. So, 12 × 7 means adding 12 seven times. That might be a way to think about it, but there could be a faster method.\n\nI can break it down using the distributive property. For example, 12 × 7 is the same as (10 + 2) × 7. Then, I can do 10 × 7 and 2 × 7 separately.\n\n10 × 7 = 70\n\n2 × 7 = 14\n\nThen, add them together: 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nI could also think of it as 7 × 12, which is the same thing. 7 × 10 = 70, 7 × 2 = 14, then 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nSince I know my multiplication tables, I might just recall that 7 times 12 is 84. But I should show the thinking, so breaking it down is better.\n\nAnother way is to use doubling or other tricks, but that might not be necessary here.\n\nI can think in terms of groups: if I have 12 groups of 7, or 7 groups of 12, it should be the same.\n\nBut for this, the distributive property seems efficient.\n\nLet me confirm the calculation: 12 × 7.\n\n12 × 7: 7 × 10 = 70, 7 × 2 = 14, 70 + 14 = 84. Yes.\n\nI know that 10 × 7 = 70, and 2 more 7s are 14, so 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nTo be thorough, let's add it up: 12 + 12 = 24, +12 = 36, +12 = 48, +12 = 60, +12 = 72, +12 = 84. That's seven times, and it ends at 84. But that might take longer, so the first method is better for internal thinking.\n\nSince it's brief, I'll go with the breakdown.\n\nSo, internal thinking: Break 12 into 10 and 2. Multiply each by 7: 10×7=70, 2×7=14. Add them: 70+14=84.\n\nI could also say, since 12 is 12, and 7 is 7, but that's not thinking.\n\nAnother trick: 12 × 7, I know that 7 × 12 is the same, and I might remember from tables.\n\nBut showing the breakdown is fine.\n\nFinally, the answer is 84.\n\nNow, to present it: I need to show the internal thinking briefly, then the answer.\n\nSo, something like:\n\nInternal thinking: I broke 12 into 10 and 2. Then, 10 times 7 is 70, and 2 times 7 is 14. Adding those gives 84.\n\nThen, the result is 84.\n\nSince the user said \"solve 12*7\", I should just state the answer clearly.\n\nAlso, in the response, I can write it as:\n\nTo solve 12 × 7:\n\n- Break 12 into 10 and 2.\n\n- Multiply 10 by 7: 70\n\n- Multiply 2 by 7: 14\n\n- Add 70 and 14: 84\n\nSo, 12 × 7 = 84.\n\nThat seems concise.",
