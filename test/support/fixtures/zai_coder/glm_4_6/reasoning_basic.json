            "reasoning_content": "1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Task:** Solve 12 * 7.\n    *   **Constraint:** Show your internal thinking (brief).\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Mathematical Operation:** Multiplication. The problem is 12 multiplied by 7.\n\n3.  **Brainstorm Mental Math Strategies for 12 * 7:**\n    *   **Strategy 1: Standard Multiplication (Distributive Property):** This is the most common and reliable method taught in schools.\n        *   Break down 12 into its place values: 10 and 2.\n        *   Multiply each part by 7.\n        *   (10 * 7) + (2 * 7)\n        *   70 + 14\n        *   84\n        *   *Self-check:* This is solid. It's easy to explain and follow.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2: Doubling/Halving (Compensation):** This can sometimes be faster if the numbers work out well.\n        *   Double one number and halve the other. The product remains the same.\n        *   Double 12 -> 24\n        *   Halve 7 -> 3.5\n        *   Now calculate 24 * 3.5.\n        *   This is *not* easier. 24 * 3 is 72. 24 * 0.5 is half of 24, which is 12. 72 + 12 = 84.\n        *   *Self-check:* This works, but it's more complex than Strategy 1. It introduces decimals. Not the best choice for a *brief* explanation.\n\n    *   **Strategy 3: Repeated Addition (for smaller numbers):**\n        *   7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7\n        *   *Self-check:* This is tedious and inefficient for 12. Definitely not the best strategy.\n\n    *   **Strategy 4: Using known facts:**\n        *   I know my times tables up to 10 * 10.\n        *   I know 12 * 6 = 72 (commonly memorized for things like inches in a foot, or months in a year, etc.).\n        *   So, 12 * 7 is just one more group of 12.\n        *   72 + 12 = 84.\n        *   *Self-check:* This is a very fast and efficient mental math strategy for someone who knows the 12 times table. It's also easy to explain.\n\n4.  **Select the Best Strategy for the \"Brief Internal Thinking\" Constraint:**\n    *   Strategy 1 (Distributive Property) is the most fundamental and universally understood. It clearly shows the \"how.\" `10*7 + 2*7`.\n    *   Strategy 4 (Known Facts) is also excellent and very \"internal.\" It's how many people would actually do it in their head. `12*6 + 12`.\n\n    *   Let's combine them for a comprehensive but brief answer. The primary thought process is usually the distributive property, so I'll lead with that. It's the most \"show your work\" friendly.\n\n5.  **Structure the Final Answer:**\n    *   **Part 1: The final answer.** State it clearly and upfront. `84`.\n    *   **Part 2: The internal thinking.**\n        *   Start with the chosen method. \"I'll break down 12 into 10 and 2.\"\n        *   Show the steps: \"First, multiply 10 by 7, which is 70.\"\n        *   Show the next step: \"Then, multiply 2 by 7, which is 14.\"\n        *   Show the final combination: \"Finally, add the two results: 70 + 14 = 84.\"\n    *   **Review against constraints:** Is the answer correct? Yes. Is the internal thinking shown? Yes. Is it brief? Yes, it's a few short sentences. The structure is clear and easy to follow.",
