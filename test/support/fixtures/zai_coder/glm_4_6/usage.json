This calls for an equally friendly and welcoming response.\n\nI should make sure my response is:\n- Warm and inviting\n- Professional yet approachable\n- Open-ended to encourage further conversation\n- Helpful in showing my capabilities without being overwhelming\n\nThe user hasn't specified any particular task or question yet, so I should keep my response general but inviting. I want to communicate that I'm here to help while leaving the door open for them to share what's on their mind.\n\nPerhaps I could offer some gentle guidance about what I can assist with, while keeping it light and not too formal. After all, they started with a casual greeting, so I should match that tone while still being professional.\n\nI think I'll go with a response that's cheerful, welcoming, and gently prods them to share what they need help with, while giving some examples of what I can do. This should help them feel comfortable continuing the conversation.",
